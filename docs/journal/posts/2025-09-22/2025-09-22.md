[Imogene](imogene-kane.md) tells the crew everything she knows about [Sycorax](sycorax.md) distribution.
[Ukko-Ukka](ukko-ukka.md) of the Solarian Church makes the drug, and [DopTown](doptown.md) is somehow involved in the process.
[Yandy](yandy.md), leader of [Golyanovo Il Bratva](bratva.md), is in charge of the whole operation.
[Imogene](imogene-kane.md) cuts off her own finger as proof that we found her.
The crew is "escorted" by armed guards to see [Yandy](yandy.md) and [Ingus](ingus.md).
[Yandy](yandy.md) offers us a job to attract and destroy some **The Company** higher-ups.
We look at available [sleeves](icebox.md#sleeves), but they're too expensive.
The crew considers how to spend [Yandy](yandy.md)'s `100K` advance on [slickware](icebox.md#slickware) and [cyberware](chop-shop.md#cyberware).
[Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) goes into surgery first but starts having a reaction.
The [Babushka](babushka.md) diagnoses [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) and finds that he already had mods secretly installed by **The Company**.

## Imogene Explains Sycorax

- [Imogene](imogene-kane.md) explains what she knows about [Sycorax](sycorax.md)
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md): I've been working with [Ukko-Ukka](ukko-ukka.md)

    - [Ukko-Ukka](ukko-ukka.md) had been helping with food and oxygen around [DopTown](doptown.md)
    - now that the oxygen is fixed, they can spend more time on [Sycorax](sycorax.md)
    - They come down to the choke, they might be harvesting something down there
- The choke is a 20 story cliff above a mostly abandoned city
    - I don't think you should go there.

    - I don't think [Ukko-Ukka](ukko-ukka.md) really has an interest in distributing it, but [Yandy](yandy.md) has something on everyone...

## Imogene Sends Proof

- [Ink](ink.md): [Ingus](ingus.md) sent us down here to locate you
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md): Well, that means I made a name for myself enough that [Yandy](yandy.md)'s probably trying to figure out where I am and how to kill me
    - [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md): Don't worry, we're not going to
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md): I wouldn't blame you if you did, but you can tell them that you guys fixed this thing and we're done
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md) pulls off her glove, pulls out a knife, cuts off her trigger finger, hands it to you, and them stems the bleeding
    - [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md): Thanks, lady...
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md) goes a bit pale: "They'll know I'm done fighting"
    - [Ink](ink.md) hands the finger to [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md)

    - [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md): "Never mind, Colonel."

    - [Yandy](yandy.md): "2 million credits"
