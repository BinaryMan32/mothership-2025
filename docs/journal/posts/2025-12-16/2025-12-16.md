# {{ page.meta.module }}: {{ page.meta.title }}

The crew and [Noriko](noriko.md) follow [Arkady](arkady-volnichi.md)'s advice to dock with [The Deep](the-deep.md) on floor 6 at hatch `61E`.
They explore many rooms containing power, heat, and atmospheric proccessing and monitoring systems.
[Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) finds unusual purple crystals inside an access panel in `61C`.
The reactor control room `60H` has strange graffiti on the wall: "The frog in the well cannot conceive of the ocean".
Before leaving, [Ink](ink.md) rigs a remote shutoff switch.
In power monitoring `60G` the readouts appear to be faked.
[Ink](ink.md) inspects suspicious air ducts but toxic chemicals prevent further investigation.
Metallic webs block access to inactive power routing controls in `60F` and partially obstruct the airlock corridor `60E`, but the crew avoid touching them.
While [Dex](dex-miro.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) are busy testing the android scanners on each other in the Algae Farm `60D`, a group of troubleshooters approach.
Murderbot identifes himself as an android, the troubleshooters open fire, and the crew surrenders.
Zeke floats in silent contemplation as the troubleshooters secure the rest of the crew and their weapons and drag them through a few rooms.
In the corridor `59B` with graffiti "You can't take it with you", the troubleshooters demand that we surrender any artifacts.
[Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) produces the crystals, one of which attaches to his chin.
He hurls a handful of crystals at the troubleshooters, which stick to the troubleshooters but not the crew.
The troubleshooters scream that [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) is trying to take over their minds.
As the troubleshooters complain they can't continue because of the crystals, a horrifying spider creature emerges.

## Docking With The Deep

- [Arkady](arkady-volnichi.md) suggests we enter on floor 6 at the hatch `61E`
- we depart for [The Deep](the-deep.md)
- the station seems enormous as we approach
    - we pass by other 6th floor hatch `58D` which appears to be a large hangar
- hatch at `61E` is smaller and takes more finesse to maneuver and dock
    - extend pressure barrier and connect to [The Deep](the-deep.md)'s hull
    - this entrance appears to be a maintenance airlock
    - [Dex](dex-miro.md) traverses the airlock
