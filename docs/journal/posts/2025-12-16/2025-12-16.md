- [Arkady](arkady-volnichi.md) suggests we enter on floor 6 at the hatch `61E`
- we depart for [The Deep](the-deep.md)

- the station seems enormous as we approach
- we pass by other 6th floor hatch `58D` which appears to be a large hangar
- hatch at `61E` is smaller and takes more finesse to maneuver and dock
- extend pressure barrier and connect to [The Deep](the-deep.md)'s hull
- this entrance appears to be a maintenance airlock
- [Dex](dex-miro.md) traverses the airlock
- lights are out
    - lots of signs for flammable materials
    - the bell may have been attached here
- find duct in the ceiling
    - remove a grate to access and replace it behind us
- enter `61D`
    - control console encased in glass
        - large red switch marked **Override**
    - heavy duty vacsuit
        - mag boots
        - welder
- airlock to `61C` is locked
    - [Ink](ink.md) takes the welder and cuts through the door
    - teamsters expertly dodge the hot metal chunk released
        - it bounces off the console cover
- `61C` contains banks of heavy-duty transformers and flow regulators
    - control board with an access panel
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) opens the access panel
    - purple crystals (see 32) stashed inside
- go south towards one of the doors
    - spend 30 min crossing
    - [Ink](ink.md) uses welder to cut through the next door
    - warns [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) about hot metal globs
- enter `61B`
    - backup reactors with radiation warnings
    - warning sign not to fire weapons
- enter `61A` with large heat sinks and 5 cooling fins
    - room goes through extreme cycles of heating and cooling
    - we think both vac suits and hazard suits can handle it
    - spend 30 min traversing
- `60H` has narrow inspection clamber-ways around a shielded nuclear reactor core
    - investigate the control room
    - written on the wall: "The frog in the well cannot conceive of the ocean"
    - [Ink](ink.md) attempts to set up a remote shutoff switch
        - takes 20 minutes but he succeeds
- head east into a corridor
    - no gravity in here
- head south to `60G`
    - office with monitoring stations reporting on power generation and distribution
    - newly installed metal air duct grills
    - check the readouts
        - data must be old or fake
        - indicate power in this room should be on, but the lights are out
    - [Ink](ink.md) removes one of the air duct grills
        - hear a faint sound of breaking glass
        - hazard suit displays a toxic chemical warning but protects [Ink](ink.md)
    - [Ink](ink.md) wants to explore the duct but might get stuck due to bulky hazard suit
        - doesn't want to remove hazard suit because of toxic chemical
- head north to `60F` power routing controls
    - controls do not appear to be lit up
    - glittering threads of steel web are all over the panels
- [Ink](ink.md) uses the welder to cut through the north door
- leads to airlock `60E`
    - 3 lockers, 2 have a faulty sticker on them
    - metal webs criss-cross the corridor
        - [Ink](ink.md) opens a non-faulty locker
            - finds a rubber grounding suit
        - [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) opens a faulty locker
            - finds a rubber grounding suit
    - [Ink](ink.md) and [Dex](dex-miro.md) assist everyone else through the webbing
        - nobody touches a web
- enter algae farm `60D`
    - it's warm and humid in here
- [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) scans [Dex](dex-miro.md) and confirms he is not an android
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) scans himself and confirms he is an android
- 4 figures in black suits with red visors float towards us
    - they appear to be well armed
    - signal to each other to take up defensive positions
    - Troubleshooter: "Identify yourselves"
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "I am an android"
    - Troubleshooter: "You identify as an android?"
- Troubleshooters open fire
    - [Dex](dex-miro.md) is wounded in the neck
- [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "Stop shooting! Kilroy sent us"
    - Troubleshooter: "Surrender your weapons"
    - we push our weapons over to them
    - some cover us and the others tell us to zip tie each other
    - troubleshooters zip tie the last one
    - Troubleshooter: "Collect the weapons"
- [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) stays still, hoping the troubleshooters will ignore him
- troubleshooters loop all of our arms together with a metal wire
    - also loop our weapons
    - pull us along behind them
- enter `59D`
    - atmospheric monitoring room
    - one of the consoles shows a warning from the damage from our encounter
- take us into `59B`
    - lights are on in this area
    - bloodstained half-meter spikes on the tunnel walls
    - graffiti: "You can't take it with you"
- Troubleshooter: "Do you have an artifact on you?"
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "What's an artifact?"
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) wiggles a crystal out of his pocket
    - slips out of his fingers, floats up to his chin, and fuses with his skin
    - Troubleshooter: "Yeah, that looks like a fucking artifact."
- [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "You mean these artifacts?"
    - throws the remaining crystals towards the troubleshooters
    - crystals stick to the soldiers, but bounce off the crew members
- murderbot's consciousness merges with the troubleshooter
    - "He's trying to take over our minds!"
    - murderbot shuts down
    - [Ink](ink.md) triggers his Espernetic Feedback Loop, but fails
- Troubleshooter: "Now how are we getting through this?"
- Door opens and a horrifying creature emerges
