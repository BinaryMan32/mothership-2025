Onboard the [Zhuangzi](zhuangzi.md), [Rachael Kilroy](rachael-kilroy.md) briefs the crew on their mission to install 4 encrypted radio transmitters, scout a secure location, and download the database from an AI core.
The crew is concerned about how to determine if someone is an android, so she provides a **Cybernetic Diagnostic Scanner**.
On the way to [The Deep](the-deep.md), the crew stops to investigate its detached engine: [The Bell](the-bell.md).
[Arkady](arkady-volnichi.md) (**Verified Human**) helps them dock and delivers an unusual but friendly welcome.
[Ink](ink.md) and [Dex](dex-miro.md) explore the [The Bell](the-bell.md), discovering **The Chapel** with a man (**Ghost Eater**) in silent prayer.
In an adjacent green space, they find [Noriko](noriko.md) preparing a welcoming site for **The Minotaur** (Monarch's greatest artifact which may cure any illness).
[Noriko](noriko.md) agrees to accompany the crew to [The Bell](the-bell.md) to find **The Minotaur**.
