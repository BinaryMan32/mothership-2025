# {{ page.meta.module }}: {{ page.meta.title }}

Amidst the hunter's webs in **60B**, the crew install the first of [4 encrypted radio transmitters](2025-12-03.md#mission-briefing) from [Rachael Kilroy](rachael-kilroy.md).
In [60C Firing Control](#60c-firing-control), [Ink](ink.md) rigs a kill switch for the lasers.
The crew discover some [Acid Sacs in 59G](#59g-acid-sacs), but decide not to push through after some tests.
[Ink](ink.md) connects his tattletale to [Communications in 57G](#57g-communications).
[Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) hacks [Communications Storage](#57h-communications-storage) but is blocked before he can discover the meaning or destination of encoded transmissions from the station.
The [Monarch AI introduces themselves](#meeting-monarch), demanding [Commander Kilroy](rachael-kilroy.md)'s death in exchange for the economic model.
[Dex](dex-miro.md) sets up another encrypted radio transmitter in **54B**.
As he finishes, a ghostly apparition in a lab coat appears, with a halo of blades around his head.
The apparition charges, and the crew is unable to do anything to stop it.
After [Ink](ink.md) is injured in the struggle, he opens another door.
Two children run out screaming, and the apparition winks out.
