The crew explore [Prospero's Dream](prosperos-dream.md) during some much needed R&R.
[Ink](ink.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) accept a mission to find [Imogene Kane](imogene-kane.md) in [DOPTown](doptown.md).
[Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) promises to save the people in [DOPTown](doptown.md), who are barely surviving on minimal O~2~.
They take us directly to [Imogene](imogene-kane.md), who gives us directions to the air processing plant.
On their way, the crew is ambushed by a group of spearmen, another group of children, and a mysterious creature.
[Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) repair the air processing plant, earning [Imogene](imogene-kane.md)'s trust.

    - many wires cross the door like veins
    - building is 2-3 stories tall

- walk around and look for another way in
    - find a small entrance marked `EST-03`
    - Environmental Scrubbing Tower
    - hole gouged in the side of the building
    - big enough for a person to squeeze through
- [Ink](ink.md) volunteers [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) to go through first
    - have to take off hazard suits to squeeze through
        - put them back on afterwards
        - while changing, our lungs strain to get any air at all
        - lungs are burning, feel like we're drowning
- no light inside the building
    - we turn on flashlights
    - machinery is running, but barely
- arrive at control rooms
    - terminal banks are powered down
    - rusty, crumbling staircase up nearby
    - we go one at a time and it groans under our weight

    - pry it open
- enter neighboring room
    - find `3` bloodless corpses
    - stash of pulse rifle ammo
    - `3` tanks with a total of `19` hours of O~2~

- [Dex](dex-miro.md) and [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) take a closer look at the thing

    - [Ink](ink.md): "Not sure about that, but it might have kept it from getting fixed."
    - [Ink](ink.md): "We're worried there's more foul play going on here, and we think you should protect it."
- [Ink](ink.md): "What do you know about the people running this base?"
    - [Imogene](imogene-kane.md): "Oh, the [Bratva](bratva.md)? They're not terrible. They're just mostly greedy"
    - "The people sent down here into Dop Town... It's really just a matter of money. It's not malicious."
    - "There are a few in Tempest Company that take joy in harming people, and seeing our suffering, but for the most part, it's just a matter of financial distribution. You know, they want to be rich."
    - "We can't pay, they put us down here. If we've got O~2~ for free, they don't have anything on us anymore."
