All of the survivors try to escape by traveling through the sphincter.
[Ink](ink.md) finds and uses a peculiar but effective alien weapon.
[Hinton](hinton.md) attemps to use the [Carcs](carcinids.md) for galactic domination.
[Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) fights an uphill battle of intelligence and will against [Hinton](hinton.md) and ends up in a coma.
[Murderbot](murderbot.md), [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md), and [Novikov](novikov.md) defeat [Hinton](hinton.md) and escape with his head, at the cost of [Murderbot](murderbot.md)'s life.
Everyone is infected by the [Carcs](carcinids.md), including [Moss](moss.md) remotely, but [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) is eventually able to cure them all.
The crew receive their payment and wonder whether it's worth the price they paid.

## The Survivors

- everyone else goes gathers supples
    - take all the explosives since they're the most effective
- all survivors enter into the sphincter
- water is slowly coming into the tunnel, there's only about an inch
- shortly after entering the tunnel, groups are able to contact each other on comms

## Exploring

### An Alien Arm

- [Ink](ink.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot.md) don't think there's anything more to do with the grate
- They try to navigate through the metallic web in the other branch of the tunnel

![Pushing through the metallic web in the tunnel](./metallic-web.png)
/// caption
Pushing through the metallic web in the tunnel
///

- The webbed tunnel opens into a large cylindrical chamber
    - warty polyp in the center
    - protruding from the polyp is a 3 meter long [carc](carcinids.md)-like limb
    - there are 2 metallic nodules embedded in the floor
        - one is a bit more recessed
    - fleshy, calcified tendrils as thick as your forearm criss-cross the room

![Room with alien arm and 2 metallic nodules in the floor](./alien-arm-nodules.png)
/// caption
Room with alien arm and 2 metallic nodules in the floor
///

- [Ink](ink.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot.md) look for footprints
    - difficult to recognize anything with the organic floor and many marks on it
    - the marks could be from [Carcs](carcinids.md) walking
        - they continue up the wall
    - [Ink](ink.md) finds a tight seam that looks very difficult to pry open
- Studying the walls, [Murderbot](murderbot.md) notices slight movement
    - like something moving under the skin
- [Ink](ink.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot.md) describe the room to [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md)
    - [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) recommends manipulating the arm to touch various objects
- [Ink](ink.md) moves the arm to touch one of the metallic nodules
    - electricity arcs between the arc and the nodule as it approaches
    - the arm snaps into place
    - a wall opens up (not the place with the seam)
    - a passage behind it angles upwards
- other group arrives at the metallic webbing
    - ask scout group for confirmation and then push through
    - [Ink](ink.md) and [Murderbot](murderbot.md) wait 10 minutes for them to arrive in the room
- [Ink](ink.md) moves the arm to the other metallic nodule
    - open door shuts
    - door opens at the seam to an adjacent room with a pool of liquid in the center

### Finding a Peculiar Weapon

- rifle-sized tube connected by umbilical cord to a sac with fleshy straps coming off it
    - top of the tube has fleshy finger length spines growing out of it

![Ink finds a peculiar alien weapon](./ink-finds-weapon.png)
/// caption
[Ink](ink.md) finds a peculiar alien weapon
///

- [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) is fascinated by this
    - [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md): "I don't think it's a [Carc](carcinids.md) itself, it might be one of their creations."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot.md): "They can create things?"
    - [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md): "They are, in my estimation, a higher form of evolution than we are"
- [Ink](ink.md) asks [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) how to extract the artifact
    - [Ink](ink.md) dips his pulse rifle into the liquid
    - it doesn't react
    - [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) collects a sample of the liquid
- [Ink](ink.md) goes in the water and starts flailing around
    - marines do not appreciate the joke
- [Ink](ink.md) pushes the sac and it feels soft like it has liquid inside
    - [Ink](ink.md) takes the sac and puts it on his back
    - tube is attached to the sac
- [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md) examines the fleshy tendrils in the main room

### Valdez Makes a Plan

- [Ink](ink.md) moves the arm back to the first nodule
- locator shows [Hinton](hinton.md) is nearby
    - gets even closer and we go up the passage
- [Valdez](valdez.md) doesn't appreciate the complete lack of a plan
    - she's freaking out about all of the weird alien shit
    - wants to leave the civies behind with a couple marines to guard
    - [Yang](yang.md) and Pedro stay behind to guard the civies [Edem](dr-edem.md), Sobol, and Kawaguchi
- [Valdez](valdez.md), Tanaka, and Novikov accompany us further up the passage
    - after `100m` it opens up into a cavernous area
    - 3 starcases, each of which has a [Carc](carcinids.md) noble (4 stories tall)
    - [Carc](carcinids.md) nobles appear to be wrapped in webbing
    - hundreds of [Carcs](carcinids.md) around the chamber

## Carc Noble Chamber

### Hinton and the Machine

- [Hinton](hinton.md) is working on a machine
    - [Carcs](carcinids.md) nearby aren't bothering them

    - [Murderbot](murderbot.md): "Do not allow it to complete its task."
    - no reaction from the [Carc](carcinids.md)
    - either it's not loud enough or [Murderbot](murderbot.md) isn't making the right sounds
- [Jenson](jenson.md) says [Hinton](hinton.md)'s transfer is 90% complete

### Disconnecting the Noble
