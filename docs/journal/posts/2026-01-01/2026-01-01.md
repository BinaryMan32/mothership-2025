The crew attempts to fight a terrifying creature in the corridor while it methodically eviscerates the troubleshooters.
Once wounded, the creature escapes.
[Ink](ink.md) attempts to salvage some crystals from one of the android troubleshooters.
The stress of cutting up what appears to be a human is too much for [Ink](ink.md), and he takes off after the creature in a rage.
[Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md) and [Dex](dex-miro.md) are able to follow using their strength or zero-g training, while the rest of the crew fall behind.
The creature wraps [Ink](ink.md) in webbing and pulls him into the next room.
As [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md) and [Dex](dex-miro.md) pursue, the creature sets a trap and cuts off [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md)'s toes.
[Dex](dex-miro.md) sacrifices his vibechete to finish off the creature.
The crew find, analyze, and take a strange silver lance with copper cabling.
They recover 12 memory cores from the creature and its android victims.
Back in the corridor, [Zeke](zeke-sinclair.md) performs an autopsy on a troubleshooter.
Except for a small android "brain" device, it's indistinguishable from a human, even when using a scanner.
