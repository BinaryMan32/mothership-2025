- [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md) boots up
- [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "Did you know you have a panic button?"
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "A panic button? What is that?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md):  "Umâ€¦ it can cause you to detonate."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "That is insane. Why would I have a panic button?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md):  "It looks like the company wanted you to spy on us."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "I have no such directive from the company. Is the panic button now gone?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "No, it's still there."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "What will cause this panic button to go?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "It used to be people around you talking negative things about the company, like planning or plotting against the company."
    - [Dex](dex-miro.md): "I'm honestly surprised we hadn't set it off already by accident."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "There is still a panic button inside me. Is this correct? What will trigger this panic button?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "Me saying a word. Or your death."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "What is this word? Well, please write it down, so that I may know to avoid it."
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "No, only I can say it. It has to be my voice."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "Well, yes, but it is your voice, so don't say it. Just write it down."
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "I won't say it, or write it down. I don't anticipate needing it."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "I hope not! But as of now, there is no word that is programmed to trigger the panic button, is that correct?"
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "No, there is. I just didn't tell anyone what it was."
    - [Carnoc](carnoc-ashbrow.md): "Murderbot, you can feel safe. You don't need to be concerned about this. That's an order."
    - [Murderbot](murderbot-v2.md): "Order received."

    - CEO: "Well, we have the formula, but it does allude to a specific ingredient that is hard to come by. Is this Solarian fruit on the station?"
    - [Dex](dex-miro.md): "We didn't spend much time talking to [Ukko-Ukka](ukko-ukka.md). we know the Solarian Church is involved in farming something, and they're the ones manufacturing [Sycorax](sycorax.md).
