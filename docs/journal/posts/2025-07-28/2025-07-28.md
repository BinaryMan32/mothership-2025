    - look for papercuts all over
    - after that, body seems to disconnect from the mind

        - note: synths also suffer from radiation

## What's Next?

1. Go to the reactor to find out what happened to Hinton and Jenson
    - if the reactor stops working, the dam will fail and the [Carcs](carcinids.md) will get us
2. Take Dr. Kawaguchi to identify and recover [Dr. Edem](dr-edem.md)'s research
    - essential to continue work on curing the infection
3. Restore communications so we can all get out of here
    - 1/4 mile trip across the dam on 2 ATVs, with [Carcs](carcinids.md) in the water
