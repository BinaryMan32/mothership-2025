The crew returns to [Prospero's Dream](/places/prosperos-dream/index.md) and are debriefed by [Yandy](yandy.md).
[Ingus](ingus.md) proposes a mission to retrieve an economic model from rogue androids which pays 350 million credits.
An engineer [Loshi](loshi.md) upgrades the crew's **Raider** with an experimental engine.
After waiting a couple months for the engine modifications, the crew travels to the android station.
A small fleet of troop ships guards the station, known as [The Deep](the-deep.md).
The crew docks with the lead ship, the **Zhuangzi**, and its commander [Rachael](rachael-kilroy.md) briefs us on the androids.
No one is allowed in or out of [The Deep](the-deep.md) since the android infiltrators are able to mimic humans.

## Deep Briefing

- [The Deep](the-deep.md) went offline a few years ago

    - facility can print androids that mimic the people they replace, called Infiltrators
    - now have a strict policy of no one going in or out
    - returning teams are under high scrutiny to determine whether they are androids
    - there are rumors of artifacts attracting all sorts of archaeologists, mostly treasure hunters
    - will shoot down any ship coming or leaving
    - don't want the Infiltrators to escape and run amok elsewhere
    - androids on [The Deep](the-deep.md) are evolving
    - it's becoming harder to tell who is human
- [Rachael](rachael-kilroy.md) is one of the few who has been to [The Deep](the-deep.md) and made it out alive
