[GM] 21:27:25
Dex and Karnak watched ink kind of disappear into, you know.

[GM] 21:27:29
room, um… And as they drew closer, they were in for a surprise where.

[GM] 21:27:36
Uh, the Hunter ambushed them, uh, severing… How many toes did we come up with for… Uh, Carnoc to lose, I think it was 2 or 3.

[GM] 21:27:47
Something along those lines. Um… But, uh, Dex put an end to it by.

[GM] 21:27:56
shoving his vibechete into it. Uh, however, in the process of destroying his vibechete.

[GM] 21:28:04
Um…

[GM] 21:28:08
Let's see…

[Dex Miro] 21:28:10
The notes say 3 toes. But not which toes.

[GM] 21:28:13
Yeah. Um… I like the vibechete has the name written on the side of it in the picture.

[Dex Miro] 21:28:20
Yeah, but not correctly.

[GM] 21:28:21
Yeah. Uh, you guys come across, uh… Another artifact, which is a silver lance, um… get which number that was.

[GM] 21:28:34
But… And… I'm not sure did you guys get besides that?

[GM] 21:28:43
Um… searched other bodies, they're all androids, removed the logic cores… Those are to be sold back at the bell.

[GM] 21:28:51
Um, to the Russian… Um… Zeke performs an autopsy on a troubleshooter. Oh, right, you guys essentially did some tests on the dead bodies because you were.

[GM] 21:29:05
assumed that they were androids, given that the artifact, the purple crystals.

[GM] 21:29:10
sealed themselves in their skin, but. you know, they were so lifelike and had.

[GM] 21:29:16
You know, such a, um… human-like behavior that you guys did some tests to figure out that your tracker, or tracker… Analyzer? Analyzer.

[GM] 21:29:26
Your analyzer can actually, um… can tell the difference between.

[GM] 21:29:31
uh, humans and androids, but it's very subtle, very difficult to… to identify the location of where that.

[GM] 21:29:39
sort of logic, or… You know, is, or can be… Identified it, so… Anyways, you would need some time and some patience with the subject in order to figure out if they're really an android or not.

[GM] 21:29:56
A quick scan will not… will not reveal.

[GM] 21:30:04
Um, and that's where we left it, so on the… map, I believe we are still in, uh, essentially 59B?

[GM] 21:30:17
And or… I mean, you guys have traveled into 60B, but 59B, 60B, somewhere in there.

[GM] 21:30:33
And the reminder of the main mission, you are to place each one of you has a rather large device on your back.

[GM] 21:30:40
Um, 4 of them are transmitters that. Um… Rachel Kilroy wants you to place on floors 2.

[GM] 21:30:50
3.1, 4, and 6. The other big backpack thing is the analyzer.

[Ink] 21:30:59
I'd like to place one on floor 6. That's Roy.

[GM] 21:31:02
Okay, you guys are in floor 6. You're just… Yeah, 59B or 60B, somewhere in between there. So, like, 60B was the, uh, layer of the… Um, spider creature?

[Ink] 21:31:06
You said we were in 60B or 59B?

[GM] 21:31:18
And then, because, um… Murderbot and Zeke were back in the hallway, they're back in 59B.

[GM] 21:31:26
So, um… 60A to give you a little bit of… Um… Sense of what was in between.

[GM] 21:31:36
Uh, was this big, rather large room that had a bunch of spider webs.

[GM] 21:31:41
crisscrossing it, um… But it looked like, uh, from sort of the debris in the area.

[GM] 21:31:48
that it was, uh, for, uh, air filtration, I think?

[GM] 21:31:51
Or, no, sorry, toxic sludge disposal. Massive cylinders, walls smeared with filth.

[GM] 21:31:59
Steel guiding cables from one entrance to the other.

[GM] 21:32:03
Uh, conglomerations of toxic byproduct and diseased algae from the air purifiers float here in chunks the sizes of small houses.

[Dex Miro] 21:32:11
Small houses.

[GM] 21:32:11
Yeah, pretty big.

[GM] 21:32:17
It's a very big room.

[GM] 21:32:24
So, do you… just let me know which, uh, which room you want to put the, uh… the transmitter in.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:38
You choose.

[Dex Miro] 21:32:39
Which one were we at again?

[GM] 21:32:42
You are currently… well, I don't… some people are on 59B, and some people are in 60B.

[Ink] 21:32:52
Okay, so 60B is where we find the lance.

[Ink] 21:32:56
We all kind of got together at the end, because he was doing the analysis on Lance, too, right?

[GM] 21:33:02
Yeah. Maybe? I don't know.

[Ink] 21:33:06
so we didn't check out 60C, that was on the other side of the lair.

[Ink] 21:33:11
Um… did I see any place, I guess, just relatively looks kind of… Secure might not be the right word, but… That it might be able to sit without getting, uh.

[Ink] 21:33:23
Bothered?

[GM] 21:33:29
Um… I mean, you can hide it amidst some of the, um… The webbing in this… in the layer of the… It's called The Hunter.

[GM] 21:33:40
Um, there's plenty of, like. nooks and things where, like, the… are obscured because of all the… the steel cabling that's in here.

[Ink] 21:33:51
Okay, I kind of like that, and I would assume that most people wouldn't want to go mess with where they thought the 100 was for right now, so… It seems like a good place to put it.

[GM] 21:34:01
Okay. You guys… Follow the instructions that Rachel Kilroy, uh, gave you, and… uh, set it up, you know, there's… Essentially, like, a little antenna on top, and the only thing that sort of indicates that it's running is the, um…

[GM] 21:34:16
There's a red sort of flashing LED.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:23
We put it in the corridor, 59B or whatever.

[GM] 21:34:26
No, and 60B, hidden amongst… The hunter's, uh… Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:27
And 6 dB, okay. Oh, right, in the webs.

[Ink] 21:34:38
with a roll or anything for that, GM, or is it?

[GM] 21:34:39
No, you guys… you know how to do it.

[Ink] 21:34:39
Just set up where we go. Alright.

[Ink] 21:34:44
Okay, so now my back is a little bit lighter, because I put mine there.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:49
That one.

[GM] 21:34:49
Sure. I don't care.

[Ink] 21:35:00
And then we haven't checked out 60C yet.

[GM] 21:35:03
Uh, not to my knowledge. I mean, it's possible I skipped over that part in the, uh, recap.

[GM] 21:35:08
Um, but… Not that I know.

[Ink] 21:35:10
Okay. I guess if we're… if we're there in 60B, I'd love to check out 60C then.

[GM] 21:35:19
Okay. Uh, 60C looks like… Let me check the door situation…

[GM] 21:35:39
I think that is…

[GM] 21:35:46
Regular office door. So you… it's not an airlock.

[GM] 21:35:51
You pass through into this room, um… There's an airlock door to the north.

[GM] 21:35:58
Um, but the… main features of this room are, uh, several… Uh, computer terminals. It looks like a control room of some sort.

[GM] 21:36:08
with a bunch of blinking lights. Um, after you kind of focus on some of the machines and terminals, you determined that this is actually.

[GM] 21:36:18
Um, the laser control and access point, um, so they're… The whole Cloud Bank facility is outfitted with defensive lasers, and this is where they're fired from.

[GM] 21:36:32
Um…

[Ink] 21:36:34
are… we get the sense that this stuff is online still?

[GM] 21:36:37
Yes. You could fire them.

[Ink] 21:36:42
What kind of range do they have?

[GM] 21:36:44
Not so far as to strike the, um… Uh… the… whatchamacallit, the fleet, the… The, um, blockade.

[GM] 21:36:54
But you could easily blow up the bell.

[Ink] 21:36:59
Okay. We like people on the bell, so… I'll blow the bell out.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:03
I don't think we have any reason to want to blow up the belt, but yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:04
Why would we do that?

[Ink] 21:37:08
That makes sense. Yeah. So, um…

[GM] 21:37:09
You gotta keep your options open.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:13
So we… so we couldn't blow up the… Whatever those ships were.

[GM] 21:37:18
Uh, the blockade chips? No. They're… they're for… this is like… The laser systems traditionally, you know, used for probably more defensive things of, like, taking down.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:20
No.

[GM] 21:37:29
incoming missiles or something, um… And, you know, sort of short-range, uh… fighting, um…

[Dex Miro] 21:37:31
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:37
So we could shoot at them, and then they would probably… be annoyed and shoot back.

[GM] 21:37:43
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:37:45
And so they probably are keeping their range, knowing that the.

[Ink] 21:37:49
that the well has this kind of weapon capability.

[GM] 21:37:52
Yeah, I mean, it's not exact, like, you know, you kind of, like, a… the readout from the terminals is such that it doesn't tell you… doesn't detect any other objects.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:53
Wait, so…

[GM] 21:38:03
Um, besides the bell, and, like, its vicinity, so… You don't know how much further away?

[GM] 21:38:09
But they're certainly outside the range that this system is picking up.

[Dex Miro] 21:38:14
Did we ever ask Rachel Kilroy, like, why they didn't just destroy the Deep?

[Ink] 21:38:20
No, we didn't ask that question. That's interesting.

[Dex Miro] 21:38:23
They seem, like, very concerned about lots of things that are on it.

[Ink] 21:38:30
Is it one of those things where they don't bug it, it won't bug them, and… If they were just trying to blow it up, it would, uh… may cause problems, or is it a matter of they want still stuff off. Well, they keep sending people in, right? So they want something off of the station.

[Dex Miro] 21:38:45
Yeah, probably. There were… there were probably several things she wasn't telling us.

[Ink] 21:38:46
It's a… right, we're not diagnosed.

[GM] 21:38:50
Well, I'll remind you that once the transmitters are in place, um.

[GM] 21:38:55
She wanted you to then go, um… you'd have some backup that would arrive, and then… After that, you were to go and download.

[GM] 21:39:04
a copy of a database. at 47H.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:09
But… But that's a completely different thing from what Angus wanted, which was the economic model, so… Everybody wants to steal things from the androids and then kill them.

[GM] 21:39:15
Right, right.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:22
I don't know.

[Ink] 21:39:24
So there's things of value in there. I haven't loaded up yet.

[Ink] 21:39:31
Um, you know, I jerry-rig anything with this… Uh, I'm trying to think.

[Ink] 21:39:38
I have my audio bug. there's not really… we shoot parts of the station with the laser.

[Ink] 21:39:46
Like, do we even itself?

[GM] 21:39:49
Uh… let's see…

[Dex Miro] 21:39:51
I feel like as a sensible precaution, most. Weapons that can turn usually can't hit the thing they're mounted on, but… You never know.

[Ink] 21:39:58
Yeah.

[GM] 21:40:01
So you're, like, down here? Um, at floor 6.

[GM] 21:40:09
Engineering and support. Um… you might be able to… Um… Hit the… this… this side over here?

[GM] 21:40:22
You certainly can't turn the gun inward and fire, like, up through the… the facility. Um, but you might be able to hit the… You're not sure what this is over here.

[GM] 21:40:34
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:40:35
Right, so we might be able to rig it so that you could just remotely.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:39
press the trigger and fire it. But if you want to hit something specific, I think that's problematic.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:47
I mean, is there a way to just… Do you want it to just overload and blow up the laser or something?

[Ink] 21:40:53
I was just trying to think, yeah, if it's online and works, um… if we… well, we know that she… the commander, whatever, killer or something like that, is bringing her fleet in at some point.

[Ink] 21:41:04
If we want to… but I guess blowing them up wouldn't help us.

[Ink] 21:41:10
I don't know if we could use it to mask our escape either, or anything like that.

[Ink] 21:41:15
Or defend us as we went out.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:18
Well, I mean, if there's a way that we think we could… destroy the lasers later, just in case somebody tries to use them against us? Is that a thing we could maybe rig up?

[Ink] 21:41:28
Okay, I like that. So let's… let's put a kill switch so that we can turn them off.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:33
Yeah.

[GM] 21:41:34
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:41:36
That's all fair? Okay. And yeah, that one works. So again, like, I can turn the power off the entire station with my one tail switch, I want to also be able to individually turn off the.

[Ink] 21:41:45
the lasers with another kill switch.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:48
Yeah, just keep track of which is which.

[Ink] 21:41:50
I think we'll know pretty quickly, I guess.

[GM] 21:41:56
Yeah, you take about, uh, an hour, hour and a half.

[GM] 21:41:59
Uh, and, you know, basically set up this… Um… the skill switch to be able to do that.

[Ink] 21:42:15
Let me go back to the other map here.

[GM] 21:42:18
Oh yeah, sure.

[Ink] 21:42:29
Okay, so the, uh… Passageway beach.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:29
Yeah, and in retrospect, it was maybe not a great idea, because it's probably copyrighted material, but if you did want to see it when it's on a different page.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:40
Oh, so do you think I should take that down, GM?

[GM] 21:42:44
the other… No, no, no, I think you're fine.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:45
The map.

[Ink] 21:42:50
Yeah, I think I took a picture of it somewhere, it's just easier to have GM bring it back up.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:53
Yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 21:42:54
So that's lazy. And then we'd all click on it, too, I think. Uh, so there's a passageway tunnel that would take us to 59H.

[Ink] 21:43:03
is that… or haul, okay, so that's large enough that we can move through.

[Ink] 21:43:10
Um, GM, which room had the… like, you can't take it with you.

[Ink] 21:43:16
I want to say it was 15 minutes, but that doesn't go outside.

[GM] 21:43:18
Uh… I believe that was… 59B, I'm pretty sure.

[Ink] 21:43:21
It's gonna be, okay. So then, to get outside, we have to go to 58D.

[Ink] 21:43:26
I don't know if we need to go outside, but that's just another place to go.

[Ink] 21:43:33
And then 58G is our… another way to get into 4 3.

[Ink] 21:43:37
We have to end up in Floor 3 at some point.

[Ink] 21:43:40
Right?

[Ink] 21:43:45
Because that's where we're gonna… that's our time.

[GM] 21:43:46
Uh, 3, 3.1 is where you need to. drop another transmitter.

[Ink] 21:43:50
Oh, gotcha. was it… but was it anywhere on floor 3 that we could sit, and she quit while we're waiting for her?

[GM] 21:43:58
Uh, yeah, she said that, um, you guys should find a place to.

[GM] 21:44:03
Hold up while they, they send in the backup.

[GM] 21:44:08
I think it… I don't think it had to be in floor 3, it could be anywhere.

[Ink] 21:44:12
Gotcha. So, there was a way to get from 59C to 57, but…

[GM] 21:44:16
Oh, sorry, it's anywhere on floor 3. It doesn't have to be specifically 3.1, but anywhere on floor 3.

[Ink] 21:44:20
Okay, so 3.6 would be a viable option there, if we were to go through that ventilation duct from the AG.

[GM] 21:44:25
Sure. Sure.

[Ink] 21:44:28
just that storage seems like it might be… maybe better than maintenance done, I don't know which one, but we have to get to the maintenance zone anyway to, uh… Okay. So, we want to eventually get… so we're done on floor 6 as far as our missions of placing the radio.

[Ink] 21:44:41
We need then to proceed to 2, I think it is, or 4-1.

[Ink] 21:44:45
For another radio?

[GM] 21:44:47
2, 3.1, and 4.

[Ink] 21:44:51
2, 3.1. Okay, sweet.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:54
It seems a lot easier to get to… Or first, is there a reason we wanted to do 2 next, or should we do 4 next?

[Ink] 21:44:57
Yeah, forcefully.

[Ink] 21:45:01
Uh, I don't think we have to go through 4 to get to 2, right? There's no direct route from.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:06
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:45:06
Unless we wanted to go all the way through 3, which… which I, for some reason, suspect is the… heavier in the occupied area, I don't know where I got that impression from, though.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:18
Yeah, so I guess…

[Ink] 21:45:19
Um… okay, so we don't… We don't want to go through 59B again, potentially, but see, I guess 59C is where we needed to get to.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:28
What's… what is the dotted line mean from 59G to 57A?

[Ink] 21:45:28
I'm trying to get us to floor 4. Yeah, the ventilation shaft is what the key says over on the right.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:36
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 21:45:38
So it seems like… and then Lyft Elevator is a… It's the… sorry, the… yeah, the light-colored one is a… it's a duct.

[Ink] 21:45:46
And the… the dark dashed one is a lift elevator.

[Ink] 21:45:51
So I don't think we want to necessarily climb through docs, right? So we go… from 60C to 59H.

[Ink] 21:45:57
and continue that way?

[Dex Miro] 21:46:01
Yeah. Well, are there… If there's no doubt, then there's no… door, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:46:08
So I think we have to do the duct.

[Ink] 21:46:12
Wait, you don't think we can go from 60C to 59H?

[Ink] 21:46:18
is what I was thinking.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:20
Right, but I'm saying we have to go from 59H to 59G, and then the only way.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:25
From there is the duck to 57A, right?

[Ink] 21:46:29
No, there's from 59F to 57A. Which is right below 59G.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:38
Oh, but those aren't connected, right, because there's no door.

[Ink] 21:46:41
Oh, I think that they're open rooms to each other, is what I got impressed with. They used to be right.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:45
Oh, I don't know. What does GM think?

[Ink] 21:46:47
Oh, that's weird, so they share walls, but you can't go directly to them?

[Ink] 21:46:52
Is that true? So, we're in 60C, so if we go up to 59H, and then go over to 59G.

[GM] 21:46:53
Which ones? Mm-hmm. Yep.

[Ink] 21:47:00
we can't go down to 59F.

[GM] 21:47:00
Mm-hmm. 59G connects to…

[Dex Miro] 21:47:07
I mean, at other places, they have the dot, even though they're sharing a wall, if there's a door, so I'm not sure there is a door. I guess we can… Keep going and look as we go.

[Ink] 21:47:10
Yeah, you're right.

[GM] 21:47:16
There is a connection between 59G and. Uh… wait, what was the other one you wanted to do?

[Ink] 21:47:23
59G to 59S.

[GM] 21:47:26
F? No, there's no, no direct connection to them.

[Ink] 21:47:27
Yep. So who designed it this way? So you can't… how are you supposed to… get around in here.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:32
Alright.

[Ink] 21:47:35
Oh, I guess you could go through 59A to get there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:36
Why are some of the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:40
So some of the dots are white and some of them are black. Does that…

[Dex Miro] 21:47:40
What'd you say, Zeke? I think it's just to be contrasty with the thing that they're next to.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:48
But it's done weirdly, I'll agree with that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:52
It's inconsistently contrasty.

[Ink] 21:47:54
Your symptoms. Mr. Cirque, where did you see the… I don't see the circles are doors, that's just, uh… that's not in the key.

[Dex Miro] 21:48:00
They don't have that on the key yet, just…

[Ink] 21:48:02
Okay, but it makes sense. Okay, so… So if we don't… if we want to avoid going through 59B and all that weirdness.

[GM] 21:48:03
Yeah, it's on my side of things.

[Ink] 21:48:11
That potentially would hurt us, then this is the only way, right?

[Ink] 21:48:18
Alright. I'd like to go to 59H here. Okay.

[GM] 21:48:22
Okay. You head up through the airlock door. It is not locked.

[GM] 21:48:26
Um… You float, uh, propelling yourself along the walls, um… And you enter into… This is a medium-sized room.

[GM] 21:48:42
What's the difference in terms of…

[GM] 21:48:47
I think it's well lit in here.

[GM] 21:48:57
Human-scale room…

[GM] 21:49:04
Yeah, it's well lit in here.

[GM] 21:49:12
It's the blue main. Um… Oh, okay.

[GM] 21:49:20
All right, 59H, uh…

[GM] 21:49:26
Oh, alright, whatever. Maculate expansive room, uh, with.

[GM] 21:49:31
glowing grid patterns all over the walls. Uh, you're a Teamster, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:49:36
Oh, doctor.

[Ink] 21:49:37
Yes.

[GM] 21:49:39
Um, you determined that these, uh, this is, like.

[GM] 21:49:42
Essentially, the electric grid, um, it's essentially robbing power from.

[GM] 21:49:47
all areas, uh, to… over the station. Um, there's no real… Like, you would need some sort of external… Um, support to figure out, like, what each of the things means, or you could spend a long time studying it to try and figure out.

[GM] 21:50:03
what all the connections mean, but. Um… everything is pretty high-powered, um… Meaning that you probably do not want to touch anything. There's a lot of electricity flowing through here.

[Ink] 21:50:21
Okay. Um… Alright, we probably wouldn't miss anything.

[Ink] 21:50:26
Okay, well, I'm happy to go to 59G.

[GM] 21:50:31
59G, you approach the airlock door, it is locked.

[Ink] 21:50:39
You still have that torch? Alright, I'm gonna unlock it.

[GM] 21:50:41
You got a torch.

[GM] 21:50:45
Alright, get it out, start torching the lock. Um… eventually you cut through and manually opened the door.

[GM] 21:50:57
Uh… let's see, on the other side… Um… you notice that the, uh, floor… is corroded, as if, uh, there's been signs of acid damage.

[GM] 21:51:12
Um… Yeah.

[Ink] 21:51:16
Our suits protect us from acid.

[GM] 21:51:21
Um… I don't… I don't know if the hazard suit is.

[GM] 21:51:25
Although, I think most people's suits got damaged, uh, in the fight with the… The divers.

[Ink] 21:51:31
Okay.

[GM] 21:51:54
Huh. Is there gravity in this room?

[Ink] 21:52:02
That's gonna be gravity in some rooms and not in others, so…

[GM] 21:52:09
Um…

[GM] 21:52:15
The key for each room contains a room number.

[Ink] 21:52:17
Oh my gosh.

[GM] 21:52:18
Room's name, whether room is 0G or not. Nothing indicates.

[Ink] 21:52:25
Oh.

[GM] 21:52:27
That this room is… has gravity.

[GM] 21:52:35
Uh, yeah. Oh, uh, no, this room has gravity. Apparently, a lot of these actually have gravity.

[GM] 21:52:42
Whoops, well, we'll say that the electric grid room had gravity, as well as this room.

[GM] 21:52:49
Um… you notice on the ceiling, uh, these sort of sacks of.

[GM] 21:52:56
Um, maybe flush? they're kind of clear, um… they look like, uh… I mean, frankly, silicon sacks.

[GM] 21:53:08
that are large, um… Yeah.

[Ink] 21:53:21
Silicon sex. So does it look like they belong here?

[GM] 21:53:22
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:53:25
Or, like, that's something that's… It wasn't designed, right?

[GM] 21:53:29
But… they don't look like they necessarily belong here, no.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:33
Can we tell what this room… What… what the room's purpose is, or anything like that?

[GM] 21:53:42
Um… some sort of acid washing, maybe?

[GM] 21:53:48
Given the corrosion of the steel floor.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:03
Does this look like something that the… I'm sure it would make, I don't know how we would know that.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:11
But how big are these? I didn't get a sense of that from the…

[GM] 21:54:14
Uh, they're probably… Um…

[GM] 21:54:22
the size of, like, a fully blown-up balloon, but they look like they have more density than just, like, a balloon.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:28
Okay.

[Ink] 21:54:39
I don't think I want to mess with these sacks.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:46
You said you don't want to mess with them.

[Ink] 21:54:48
I don't think I want to mess with the sacks, no, it doesn't… it doesn't intrigue much.

[Ink] 21:54:53
we check out the events ventilation chapter?

[GM] 21:54:57
Um… It's at the other end of the room.

[GM] 21:55:03
So right now, I just assume you're sort of standing in the doorway.

[Ink] 21:55:04
Do we… doing… Yeah, so can we move this room, do we think, safely, or, uh…

[Ink] 21:55:13
Or will we mess with the end of the stack, sorry.

[GM] 21:55:13
Well… I mean… There's not, like, a constant drip of acid or anything.

[Ink] 21:55:24
Um…

[GM] 21:55:27
You, you, you suspect there's a good reason to suspect that, like, the acid.

[GM] 21:55:32
pitting is coming from whatever those sacks are. And it's possible maybe, like, only if they're popped, that, like, maybe they.

[GM] 21:55:40
spray acid or something.

[Ink] 21:55:47
So there is some concern about entering this room.

[Ink] 21:55:50
That they might pop and blow acid all over us?

[GM] 21:55:54
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:59
And it's not a 0G run, right? So can't we just… not touch them.

[Ink] 21:55:59
That doesn't sound like…

[GM] 21:56:04
It is not a zero-G room.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:06
We're not… we're at least not worried about somebody accidentally floating into them.

[GM] 21:56:09
Right, yeah.

[Ink] 21:56:13
Okay, so if we don't make a spat duct, then our only way.

[Ink] 21:56:20
And how are you supposed to… oh, so you have to go out and airlock to get… And, uh, the other way.

[Ink] 21:56:26
everything else is through ventilation shafts.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:27
Wow. How… how dense are these sacks?

[GM] 21:56:34
Um, dense enough… Uh, that… I mean, there's probably about… is this a human-sized room?

[GM] 21:56:44
This is a human-sized room. Um… There's probably one… There's only, like, probably, like, a… two feet in between each sack.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:58
And they're kind of just everywhere. Oh.

[GM] 21:57:00
there's 12 total.

[Ink] 21:57:14
Okay, so our other options are through 59A and 59C.

[Ink] 21:57:18
We haven't been to 59C yet.

[GM] 21:57:22
Uh, not to my knowledge.

[Ink] 21:57:27
And 59B was a room we didn't pass through, because we were fear.

[Ink] 21:57:29
afraid that would get us, uh… Mess up.

[Ink] 21:57:40
If you're carrying artifacts, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:42
You know, this is one time I almost didn't want gravity, because I want to just see what happens if we just.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:48
push something past the sacks. Before we try to walk past them.

[Ink] 21:57:56
we could throw something in there.

[Ink] 21:58:01
No, GM, I didn't… I didn't damage the door beyond, like, wouldn't close it.

[GM] 21:58:01
You could throw something.

[GM] 21:58:05
Yeah, you can close it.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:17
Are there sacks, like, right next to the vent, or they're kind of just.

[GM] 21:58:22
Not, like, surrounding it, no.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:24
Okay. Okay, so we can… we just need to, like, get past them, and then we'll know we're past them, and then we try to deal with them.

[Ink] 21:58:30
Wait, wait, why is GM rolling? Let's get the out of here.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:32
I don't know.

[Ink] 21:58:41
Hey, I'd like to shut the door while we contemplate what we're going to do. Thank you.

[GM] 21:58:45
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:46
Makes sense.

[Ink] 21:58:51
Um… So looking at the map, right, our… our path is through.

[Ink] 21:58:58
to try to get to floor 6, other than going outside.

[Ink] 21:59:03
We need to get to 57A, right?

[Ink] 21:59:09
And then the, uh, the other way to get there is to try to go 59C to 57G.

[Ink] 21:59:16
and not pass through 59B. Or we could go through 59B and then go through 59A over… all the long way around, right?

[Ink] 21:59:28
That makes sense.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:35
What's the deal-e-o? What happened now?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:38
We're making our way around the map.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:41
Okay. Alright.

[Ink] 21:59:44
I'm trying to find us a way to get to floor 4 without going outside.

[Ink] 21:59:49
are getting acid all over us, or getting eaten by a spider anymore, or whatever else we can do.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:58
So you don't want to sneak past the sacks to the vent.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:59
I stand by.

[Ink] 22:00:02
Oh, I think maybe it's worth… we can toss something in there and see if the stacks explode, but… We're going to try to squeeze 2 feet between… I guess 2 feet is enough that we should be able to walk through very carefully, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:00:12
Yeah, we just need to know if… Like, if all we have to do is not touch them, that's fine, but if they're gonna explode when we're near them, that's not fine.

[Ink] 22:00:20
Yeah. It's…

[GM] 22:00:25
is the… is the whole party together, or is, uh… like, Murderbot and Zeke still sort of hanging back.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:32
I think we're together, we're investigating the sacks.

[GM] 22:00:36
Okay. That's what I was just trying to figure out.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:37
Is Noriko still with us?

[Ink] 22:00:43
What should you say about that, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:00:47
I mean, we definitely shouldn't let her wander around the station on her own.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:52
Can I just, like, test to see if this acts?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:55
blow up when something…

[Dex Miro] 22:00:59
Like, by sending a Rico in?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:01
Well, anything. Can we just… I don't know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:04
Throw a ball.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:07
I don't know the overall.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:09
Sure, let's…

[Ink] 22:01:10
Let's say we roll something in there, non-biological, and nothing happens.

[Ink] 22:01:14
then have we proven that they're safe? Because we're biological, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:01:16
Oh, like Murderbot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:20
That's a good point, yes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:22
Yep.

[Ink] 22:01:25
Yep, you volunteered Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:29
Sure.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:32
That was a joke, you shouldn't volunteer.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:36
Hmm.

[Ink] 22:01:36
I don't think so, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:41
All right, I think we could take…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:43
What do I have here? You have nothing.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:46
I don't have anything on my sheet anymore.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:48
For some reason, I have an acid balloon? I don't know what that is.

[GM] 22:01:51
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:51
That sounds like those acts. Oh yeah, that's… that's the glove you filled up forever ago.

[Ink] 22:01:52
You have an acid balloon? Yeah, you already collected one of those?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:54
Right?

[Ink] 22:01:59
That's funny, just to carry that around?

[Dex Miro] 22:02:00
You probably don't have that anymore. That seems like a scary thing to hold onto for a month.

[GM] 22:02:00
I'm scaring her around with him.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:02
Still carrying it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:04
Of course they have it. Alright.

[GM] 22:02:06
It's on his character she's got…

[Ink] 22:02:19
He just started, like, the first mission, right?

[GM] 22:02:22
Yeah, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:23
I don't… get, like, a ball of gas out of my first aid kit.

[GM] 22:02:26
Mm-hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:27
I want to put some biological material on it, some spit, I'll cut myself a little, put some blood on it.

[GM] 22:02:32
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:33
It seems drastic.

[Ink] 22:02:34
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:35
I throw it near one of the

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:38
balls. The…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:39
Whatever these are.

[GM] 22:02:40
Okay. Um…

[Ink] 22:02:42
You know, slam the door shut behind it after he does that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:45
Yeah, we can do that.

[GM] 22:02:47
Uh, it's hard to slam. Like, it's an airlock, you kind of have to, like… strain yourself to, like, manually and physically open it. You can keep it, like.

[Ink] 22:02:57
Murder bucks. Murder bus drone.

[GM] 22:02:59
Is he strong?

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:02
I am not. I don't know, but that's how it turned out.

[Ink] 22:03:02
Who makes a weed robot?

[GM] 22:03:08
Um, you can keep the door mostly closed such that you can take cover behind it.

[GM] 22:03:13
Um… yeah. All right, you… you throw, um… the… do you want to, like, try and hit one of the things, or do you just want to, like, pass it underneath just to see what happens?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:23
No, not… I don't want to hit it, no, like, underneath, yeah.

[GM] 22:03:25
Okay. Um, alright, you throw, uh, your biological material through the room. Um… And… that's net.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:34
That sounds bad.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:38
But they're on different biological material through the room.

[GM] 22:03:41
Um, as it passes, nothing immediate happens, but then you start to hear this sort of, like.

[GM] 22:03:48
Um… So you see little, like, um… Smoke plumes, like, tiny little ones, coming up from the ground, and you suspect that you kind of… catch little glimpses of liquid dropping from these sacs.

[Ink] 22:04:07
And it never touched the sacks, it just rolled by them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:07
Ew.

[GM] 22:04:09
Yeah, just kind of passed underneath them.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:12
And the… is it, like, dripping onto my ball, or, like, multiple sacks are dripping out?

[GM] 22:04:18
Uh, I assumed you kind of threw it deep into the room, passing underneath multiple sacks, and multiple sacks were triggered as a result.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:21
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:24
Okay, everything was triggered, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:29
MySAT gets triggered.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:34
Buzz, it's not looking reassuring.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:36
No, it's not.

[GM] 22:04:37
Uh… Noriko shows up and she hands you a gnarled configuration of twisted slag.

[GM] 22:04:43
And she says, here, throw this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:44
Oh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:46
Thanks!

[Dex Miro] 22:04:48
What?

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:52
We trust her? I'm not gonna throw that thing.

[GM] 22:04:53
Do you… do you throw it?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:57
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:58
Wait, who… who did she add it to?

[GM] 22:05:01
She… well, the guy that was throwing stuff, she ended the Zeke.

[GM] 22:05:04
Zeke throws it through the room, uh… it kind of lands with a clang, um… Maybe it might be made of, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:07
Uh-oh.

[GM] 22:05:14
uh, maybe not entirely metal, maybe some sort of, like, uh, stone-type material, but… it kind of just bounces off the steel mix clang. It does not trigger any of the sacks.

[Ink] 22:05:28
So it can get triggered by biological stuff.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:28
What does that mean? Uh, which means I gotta walk through this thing.

[GM] 22:05:32
Okay. Do you…

[Ink] 22:05:35
Yeah, but if we can, I'll get through there, then what's the point?

[GM] 22:05:40
Um… Murderbot's physique is made of what's called pseudo-flesh.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:41
Oh, that too. Distraction.

[GM] 22:05:47
which has not been yet tested. underneath these things. Is flesh.

[GM] 22:05:52
close enough to flesh, it will trigger them, or is it more mechanical enough to not trigger them?

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:59
I do the whole Terminator thing, where I cut, like, the skin, you know, and pull off.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:06
and show my robotic arm. To everybody and through my… No.

[GM] 22:06:09
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:11
I don't think you should do that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:13
I'm not doing that.

[GM] 22:06:20
You haven't lost any body parts that you want to throw through there?

[Ink] 22:06:23
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can't spare toe.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:23
So…

[GM] 22:06:24
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:28
Oh, yeah, sure. I guess I could do, like, a pinky or something.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:33
No? Is it tow better? Or a little… or pinky toe?

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:39
when I lose balance?

[Dex Miro] 22:06:43
Oh my gosh.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:44
How about, like, the tip of my pinky? My right pinky.

[GM] 22:06:44
It's up to you. There are a number of other, what you presume to be Android bodies, not that far away before you come to this extreme measure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:54
Oh, that's right. Let's throw them in there.

[Ink] 22:06:59
That's right.

[GM] 22:07:02
Um… Do you… do you go and collect an Android body?

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:09
Sure.

[GM] 22:07:10
Alright. You throw the Android body into the room, uh… This seems to trigger quite a bit of, like.

[GM] 22:07:17
Um… Acid.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:19
This is one of the troubleshooters, or…

[GM] 22:07:20
Well, it's maybe one of the bodies in the spider, uh, the hunter room.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:24
Oh, right, that's closer, yeah.

[GM] 22:07:26
Yeah. Um, you threw it in there, and it… they immediately begin to just start.

[GM] 22:07:31
raining down on it, and melting away the flesh off the body, um.

[GM] 22:07:37
What's exposed underneath is a metallic skeleton, although it's.

[GM] 22:07:42
not like a steel shiny color, it's a… it is a… looks like bone white.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:57
So it looks like bone, not metal.

[GM] 22:08:00
Yeah, but… you're pretty sure it's phone, or you're pretty sure it's metal.

[GM] 22:08:10
It is a bit unnerving watching a body dissolve.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:11
So we… wait. Yeah. I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:16
I would say so.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:16
That doesn't involve rolling, does it? Okay. Um… Alright. Well… What's our alternate route? Because this seems… Not great.

[GM] 22:08:19
did not involve a role.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:36
Unless anybody has a, uh… That's an impermeable umbrella that they're hiding in their back pocket.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:49
No, didn't think so.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:53
I have an acid-in permeable balloon.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:56
Because it has acid in it, so it must be impermeable.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:58
Alright, you're gonna stretch the glove over your entire body.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:04
Hold your breath and walk through the room, and then throw it back to the next person.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:08
Seems like a plan.

[GM] 22:09:13
I mean, to this point, um… a fully functioning hazard suite might allow you to walk through here without.

[GM] 22:09:19
Much.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:19
Does anyone still have one? Because mine's damaged. Did we pass by any lockers with hazard suits in them?

[GM] 22:09:28
Uh, kind of. Uh, back in…

[Dex Miro] 22:09:32
But there was only one that was… I don't remember the wording.

[GM] 22:09:34
Yeah, and it… I believe it had the word defective written on it, or something.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:39
Yeah, there were 3 lockers, and there was clearly 1 good one and two bad ones.

[GM] 22:09:40
So…

[Dex Miro] 22:09:47
But I don't even remember what kind of suit that was.

[GM] 22:09:53
Um, in the 60E, the power sector airlock. Uh, they had grounding suits.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:00
Groundings. Okay, so that's not necessarily even effective against acid.

[GM] 22:10:01
Uh, it's rubber grounding suits. No, it's not necessarily effective.

[Ink] 22:10:07
Okay, GM, so 59B was the room that had the, like, you can't take it with you, right?

[GM] 22:10:12
Yep.

[Ink] 22:10:14
We did… do we go through 59D?

[GM] 22:10:17
Uh, you… As far as I know, did not.

[Ink] 22:10:22
Alright, yes. Okay. Did we go through 59?

[GM] 22:10:23
Oh, yeah, yeah, you did. You went through 59D, yeah.

[GM] 22:10:31
Sorry, I missed the last part of that. I only heard 59.

[Ink] 22:10:33
Yeah, 50G, we go to 59E as an elephant?

[GM] 22:10:35
No. No.

[Ink] 22:10:37
Alright, I guess I'd like to… I'm looking at 59C to 57G.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:39
We didn't…

[Ink] 22:10:43
is what I'm looking at right now? I think that's… we should… that's worth investigating.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:45
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's the only other route, so I support this.

[Ink] 22:10:54
Got it. We trek back that way, GM. Although, I did like the glove idea for Zeke.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:55
I don't want to get acid rant on… So…

[GM] 22:10:57
Sure.

[Ink] 22:11:03
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:05
I don't know, how stretchy is it?

[GM] 22:11:06
Uh… It's not enough to get his whole body under there.

[GM] 22:11:13
Um… you arrive back at 59B, the four-way intersection.

[GM] 22:11:18
Um, do you want to go down to 59E, Elephant, or over to 59C?

[GM] 22:11:24
Which way are you guys heading?

[Ink] 22:11:25
No, it's 59B was the place that said, do not, you can't take it with you.

[Ink] 22:11:30
Or was it 59A that said that? Okay, so we…

[GM] 22:11:32
I believe it was 59B. Blood-stained half-meter spikes cover the tunnel walls, graffiti on the floor says you can't take it with you.

[Ink] 22:11:41
Okay, so we assume that they were headed. they were probably headed to take us from 59B to 59A.

[Ink] 22:11:48
I'm assuming? Okay. So, I say we go to 1590.

[GM] 22:11:48
Yes.

[Ink] 22:11:52
And then take them to, as in Donald, and take that to 59E is what I want to try to do.

[GM] 22:11:56
Okay. Uh, you're heading to 59D, you've been through this room, uh… This is where…

[Dex Miro] 22:12:01
But you don't want to go to C and then take the G?

[Ink] 22:12:05
I don't think we can go through 59B without getting zapped.

[Ink] 22:12:11
Because that's the room that says don't take it with you, and they were.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:11
Oh. Well, I mean, there's 4 exits from B, I don't know which ones go through the spikes.

[GM] 22:12:18
the… to the… the garbage sheep. Uh, sorry, that's to the north.

[Ink] 22:12:18
Oh, I was doing home.

[GM] 22:12:22
Is it 59A?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:25
Okay, so we can go to see you without going through the spikes.

[Ink] 22:12:26
Okay.

[GM] 22:12:29
I don't know why I have this covered up.

[GM] 22:12:33
Sorry, what'd you say, Dex? Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:34
We can go to sea without going through the spikes.

[Ink] 22:12:38
Oh, gotcha, I misunderstood that, okay. So it's just the corridor between A and B that has the, uh… the spikes.

[GM] 22:12:48
Yes.

[Ink] 22:12:50
Okay. Okay, so we safely have traversed through 59B before.

[GM] 22:12:56
Yes. Or… there was supposed to be, but I messed up, so there's no gravity.

[Ink] 22:12:57
And there's no gravity.

[Ink] 22:13:05
Okay, I like it.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:07
But it was fun to have no gravity in that room, so that's what matters.

[GM] 22:13:09
Yeah, it's fine, it was fine. Um, so going down 59D is where you guys went through the, um… Oxygen room, it's, uh… Let's see, dials and readouts, pressure, and atmospheric monitoring, good pressure and atmospherics on all floors, all have O2, except for floor 5.

[GM] 22:13:30
Um, I believe this is where you guys ran into the, uh…

[GM] 22:13:37
the Whatchamacallit guys. the diverse.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:42
the troubleshooters. Well, we first met them in 60D, while we were… What's the problem with scanners and the algae farm, but… So I think we… we never went through 59D under our own power, I guess.

[GM] 22:13:43
Or the troubleshooters, yeah. Oh, is it there? Yeah.

[GM] 22:13:55
Gotcha, so they just kind of force you to… okay. Well, that's what's in there.

[Ink] 22:13:56
Yeah, I think we get a drug, too.

[GM] 22:14:00
Dials, readouts, pressure, and atmospheric monitoring. Good pressure and atmospherics on all floors, except for floor 5, have O2.

[GM] 22:14:08
Uh, you have controls for atmosphere on all floors here.

[Ink] 22:14:18
Is there any, uh, compartments or anything like that, anything worth investigating?

[Ink] 22:14:22
in here.

[GM] 22:14:23
Um, not really. Nothing, like, looks like it's, like, could potentially be holding any kind of secret thing.

[Ink] 22:14:30
being purple crystals somewhere.

[GM] 22:14:32
Yeah, no.

[Ink] 22:14:35
All right, so then from 59D, we want to go to E, or we want to go up to B, and then go to C.

[Ink] 22:14:39
Let's just… we just go to 15, we check out 15 and E.

[GM] 22:14:42
Yep. Uh, door there is… Um, Office store?

[GM] 22:14:49
I think…

[GM] 22:14:53
Looks like an office door. Um, you go into 59E.

[GM] 22:14:58
uh, O2 flow backup. Tangle of ducts, vents, and pipes with accessible additive input hatches.

[GM] 22:15:05
Uh, there's a massive tank, it has steel webbing around it.

[GM] 22:15:10
In the center of the mass contains, uh, some gas.

[GM] 22:15:14
Um… which can be pumped. to any room. So, like, this is kind of, like, the… Some massive… Uh, connection to most of the duct work through this room.

[Ink] 22:15:30
Any room in the station, like, all over the station?

[GM] 22:15:34
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:15:37
Well, that's interesting.

[GM] 22:15:38
not all the ducks are big enough to. how a person travel through them, though.

[Ink] 22:15:44
Gotcha. Or we could potentially rig this up so we can get us in the room we wanted.

[GM] 22:15:47
Does… Yeah, this is an industrial scale room, so it's, like… Huge room.

[Ink] 22:15:58
You know, are they well-labeled?

[GM] 22:15:59
No. You'd need some sort of… user manual, or to have worked here quite a while to figure out.

[Ink] 22:16:05
You look quickly, Dad.

[GM] 22:16:10
where all these things go. This is even less intuitive than the electric grid.

[Ink] 22:16:14
That's case, okay.

[Ink] 22:16:23
Okay, that's 59.

[GM] 22:16:26
59E.

[Ink] 22:16:36
Okay, so then no… nothing blocking us. Oh, 159E doesn't connect to 159C. Okay, never mind.

[Ink] 22:16:43
So we have to look at it and be… okay.

[Ink] 22:16:46
Um, is it anything else? look like it could be hidden in here, GM?

[GM] 22:16:51
No, nope. I mean, I mean, you suppose, like, so many things could be hidden in any of these pipes, but, like… it would just take forever to check, and frankly, there's not a lot of access to the pipes. Like, a lot of it's just already.

[Ink] 22:16:59
Yeah. Oh.

[Ink] 22:17:05
Oh my gosh. Okay.

[GM] 22:17:05
pretty connected, so… it would have, you know, you don't see any kinds of… Uh, what looks to be, like, tampering with any of them to hide something, so…

[Ink] 22:17:14
Gotcha. I'm ready to hit the 59C, then. via 59D2B to see.

[GM] 22:17:17
Okay. Yeah. 59c, um… you find a well-stocked depot. Any tool can be found with, with, uh… Well, you can find any tool you need in here.

[Dex Miro] 22:17:35
We'll start depot. Like… Home Depot.

[Ink] 22:17:35
Okay.

[GM] 22:17:36
Yeah. It's a… it's a tool shed. Yeah, basically, Home Depot in the… in the… station.

[Ink] 22:17:43
Oh, look over there, Dex, there's a brand new Spanner.

[GM] 22:17:47
Yeah, look, there's, like, several spanners, actually.

[Dex Miro] 22:17:50
Is there a vibechete?

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:55
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:17:56
Um… make… okay, this is… this is actually in the rule book. Make a speed check with disadvantage.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:03
A speed check.

[Ink] 22:18:04
a speech.

[GM] 22:18:04
Yeah, they… for some reason, I think they're trying to move really fast, and so, like… If you wanted to find something.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:10
If I don't find it quickly enough, it disappears.

[GM] 22:18:12
Yeah, I guess. Um… no vibe, no vibechete.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:15
Oh, no. Do I take stress for that?

[Ink] 22:18:19
Oh, man.

[GM] 22:18:20
You know, you take a little bit of stress from that.

[GM] 22:18:25
He wanted it real bad.

[Ink] 22:18:26
Oh…

[Dex Miro] 22:18:27
Oh. Uh, what does my stress have to get to before bad things happen?

[GM] 22:18:33
Um, it doesn't… it doesn't… it can go as high as possible, but you roll a D20 for a panic check, and… Um, so if you go above 20, you're… you're definitely going to panic, uh, just how extreme that panic occurs is…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:18:36
He really wanted one.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:47
Okay. When do we roll the 24-pound checks?

[GM] 22:18:48
Unknown. whenever a panic check is called for. So, typically, panic check is.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:54
Oh, okay, okay. So, just getting the stress never triggers that, it's just when you say we have to do one, I'm very likely to fail the higher it gets.

[GM] 22:19:01
Right, right.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:02
Okay, gotcha.

[Ink] 22:19:05
Um, can I make sure that my blowtorch. is refueled or something like that, or if there's a shiny new one here.

[GM] 22:19:10
Yeah, sure, sure.

[Ink] 22:19:13
Or I call it my, uh, universal key, or my cell key.

[Ink] 22:19:20
Is there anything else we need? Is there… there's no, uh, hazard seats, is there?

[GM] 22:19:23
No, no, this… it's just, like, mechanical tools. maybe some electronic tools as well, but… Mostly mechanical.

[Ink] 22:19:32
All right, we investigate that, uh, ventilation dock.

[GM] 22:19:36
Yeah. Um, you… don't need to climb up, since we're pretending there's 0G in here, um, so you kind of push yourselves up to the ceilings and connect it… take the… You know, there's probably a screwdriver floating around. You grab a screwdriver, undo the, uh…

[GM] 22:19:55
air duct, uh, vent. Um… Whatever that thing would be called. Take it off.

[GM] 22:20:02
I float down, and then you get to the other side. You look through the vent before.

[GM] 22:20:07
removing it, um, into 57G. Um… 57G is well lit.

[GM] 22:20:20
Um, you see leather operating chairs… I'm sorry, leather operator chairs, so it's like a… They're, like, cushy chairs for sitting in, and um… some damaged terminals.

[GM] 22:20:35
Uh, terminals… you kind of squint to see what's written on them. Uh, looks like communications.

[Ink] 22:20:46
communication. Alright, um, on, we can see the entire room not occupied.

[GM] 22:20:47
Yeah.

[GM] 22:20:52
It is not occupied.

[Ink] 22:20:55
But it's well lit, so somebody left the license.

[GM] 22:21:00
Yep.

[Ink] 22:21:04
Um, alright, and we don't think traps anything like that, or if… also, I'm ready to jump down, I guess, if there's…

[Dex Miro] 22:21:12
Before we leave the toll depot, is there anything there, like maps or service manuals or anything like that for the station?

[GM] 22:21:19
Uh… not readily available. You can make another speed check if you want, see if you can find one.

[Ink] 22:21:27
Okay, I'd like to… I'll do a speed check, because he is not taking that.

[GM] 22:21:30
Alright, with disadvantage, though… Yeah.

[Ink] 22:21:33
disadvantaged?

[Dex Miro] 22:21:34
Why disadvantage. Because there's so much time pressure.

[GM] 22:21:36
It's just… that's what it says in the book.

[Ink] 22:21:38
Alright, so… Um, so I'm looking through just to see if there's anything that, uh, would be helpful, that would suddenly strike me that I can't think of.

[GM] 22:21:41
Yeah, um…

[Ink] 22:21:48
Until I saw it. I guess is kind of what I'm looking for.

[Ink] 22:21:51
Does that make sense? The maps are, yeah, would be nice.

[GM] 22:21:51
Okay. Alright.

[Ink] 22:21:57
manuals, anything like that.

[GM] 22:22:00
Hey! Did not get a critically failed.

[Ink] 22:22:02
Oh, shoot! So close! So close.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:05
Do you guys will lose one of your items?

[Dex Miro] 22:22:06
Oh, I guess… I didn't think about that. The disadvantage makes it more likely to crit fail, yeah.

[Ink] 22:22:13
And definitely stepped on a rusty nail, and… Okay, so I take one stress the least for failing, and what's the critical fail do to me?

[GM] 22:22:21
Uh, the critical fail, um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:24
It opens in my wallet.

[GM] 22:22:28
I can't tell if Zeke's making it up for the game, or if it's just Zeke saying something.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:33
That would be the game.

[Ink] 22:22:33
Both are equally likely.

[GM] 22:22:37
Um… let's see, uh…

[Ink] 22:22:49
Oh no! You're rolling for it. I'm having trouble now.

[GM] 22:22:50
Hmm…

[Ink] 22:22:56
D10. I only had 7 health, though.

[GM] 22:22:57
Um…

[GM] 22:23:04
Uh, so you, like… you start going through, um… the tools and stuff in there, and you set your little blowtorch down.

[Ink] 22:23:12
Okay.

[GM] 22:23:14
Um, the… Next thing you know, you turn around and the blowtorch has caught a bunch of tools on fire.

[Ink] 22:23:17
Oh.

[Ink] 22:23:22
Yes. Bye.

[GM] 22:23:23
The fuel depot is on fire. Extremely bad.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:25
What? Why?

[Ink] 22:23:28
Okay, let's get out of here. Can we put it out? Is there a…

[GM] 22:23:33
Uh… yeah. You might be able to figure out how to suppress the airflow to the room in the O2 flow.

[Ink] 22:23:38
Wait, is there no fire extinguishers in this schoolroom?

[GM] 22:23:40
No, no, they're all on fire.

[Ink] 22:23:44
They're on to the fire extinguish it on fire.

[GM] 22:23:48
Yeah, everything's on fire. You can either flee through the air ducts, uh, to the other room, or, um… and quickly escape, or… You don't imagine the fire will spread outside this room, but it's certainly, uh, this room is engulfed.

[Ink] 22:24:03
Yeah, time to at least grab my, uh, torch.

[GM] 22:24:06
Yes. the source of all this pain.

[Ink] 22:24:08
Okay. Yeah, I got the torch.

[GM] 22:24:13
the tool… the tool shed, uh, we'll eventually burn down and burn itself out, but all the tools are essentially destroyed.

[Ink] 22:24:13
Sophie gets pile to burn itself out eventually?

[Dex Miro] 22:24:23
Is there any way to… Evacuate the air from it.

[GM] 22:24:28
Um, if you… want, you can try to go… back into the O2 flow backup and, uh, it'd be pretty risky to try and.

[GM] 22:24:39
figure out exactly what… Uh, is the flow control to the… or, sorry, the flow control room, which would be 59D.

[GM] 22:24:50
You can try and do it and save some of the tools, like, essentially, saving the tools would mean that later you could come back here and probably acquire something you needed.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:58
Right, so there's no, like, automated fire suppression system or anything?

[GM] 22:25:00
Um…

[GM] 22:25:03
Not in this room. No one thought that. you know, you guys would use tools to set other tools on fire.

[GM] 22:25:10
That just seems irresponsible. There's, like, a picture on the wall that says last number of days since last accident, and… Someone… someone said… Noriko flips it to zero.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:19
Is it a high number?

[Ink] 22:25:23
Every question about that.

[GM] 22:25:29
Do you want to try and save it?

[Dex Miro] 22:25:38
I mean, kind of, but I also don't want to make it worse.

[Ink] 22:25:38
We're gonna run into the… run into… run into the other room, I say it was a veil.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:46
I also don't want to burn the entire station down.

[GM] 22:25:49
It won't… it won't spread outside the room.

[Ink] 22:25:49
asking. Alright, I jump into the communication room.

[GM] 22:25:55
Alright. Inside of here, he, he pushes forward, um.

[GM] 22:26:02
Dex, you can still, uh… Dex could still try and shut off the O2 to this room, but now he has a risk of, like, potentially shutting off the O2 to the room that ink is in.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:12
But I have to go back to the previous room, right? Like, there's nothing we can do from here.

[GM] 22:26:14
You would have to go backwards. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:23
I mean, how big was this room? Like, how much stuff is there in it?

[GM] 22:26:28
Um, it's, uh, a normal-sized room. Um, I mean, it's like… you know, as much as, like, you might fit in… But as much as it fits in my garage.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:41
Okay.

[GM] 22:26:41
It's like a bunch of tools, but like… You don't think there's any real loss here from them being destroyed.

[GM] 22:26:49
There's… there was no tool that impressed you as a teamster.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:49
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:53
I don't think it's worth it then. Like, there's… The last drum sounded like it was the size of a football field. I don't think Eddie would find something to try before it burns out.

[GM] 22:27:02
Right. Okay. Alright, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:27:06
Alright, so we all, like, push into the next run before we… Get set on fire, I guess.

[GM] 22:27:11
Yeah. Um… 57G.

[GM] 22:27:19
Uh, yes, this is a communications room, um… Upon looking at those terminals and things, uh, you… see that the comms, uh, can reach all ships and stations in the system.

[GM] 22:27:31
So if you wanted to, you could actually… try to reach out to and connect with, um… with, uh, Rachel Kilroy, or the bell.

[GM] 22:27:42
Through this.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:45
Make sure to use Secure Channel. Whatever that meant.

[GM] 22:27:49
There's, like, a little headset you can put on.

[Ink] 22:27:50
It's okay.

[GM] 22:27:51
He'd be like, break her breaker.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:52
Yeah.

[GM] 22:28:02
Um, there's a…

[GM] 22:28:07
Normal door? It's a normal door.

[GM] 22:28:13
an airlock. door, I think.

[Ink] 22:28:16
newspaper.

[GM] 22:28:18
Airlock door to the north? I think, and then normal door to the east.

[Ink] 22:28:36
Sorry, it doesn't like anything that we changed.

[GM] 22:28:41
It's okay.

[Ink] 22:28:44
And I watched the other room, so I couldn't mute.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:28:46
Who knows?

[Ink] 22:28:52
Okay, thanks.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:05
I mean, are there any… Like, logs of previous communications we could look at that might be interesting.

[GM] 22:29:14
Um, there are… None printed or anything, um… There doesn't even seem to be, like, any kind of… Um… terminals where these things would have been recorded at.

[GM] 22:29:30
It seems more of, like, um… PA-type system.

[GM] 22:29:35
Where you can kind of just, like, dial in, like, a number or a specific sector or something.

[GM] 22:29:41
And be able to communicate.

[GM] 22:29:45
Um, if you… but you can also do two-way communication.

[GM] 22:29:52
But yeah, there's no… nothing that seems to boot.

[GM] 22:29:56
for recording.

[Ink] 22:30:03
Can I gerry-rig my tattletale into the system so I could use it remotely?

[GM] 22:30:10
You want to jerry-rig your what into it?

[Ink] 22:30:12
my title team. It's a detachable audio surveillance bug, which can be traced up to 100 kilometers.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:14
be able to, yeah.

[GM] 22:30:15
Well, I don't…

[Ink] 22:30:20
Within a 100-meter area. present me.

[GM] 22:30:24
Um…

[Ink] 22:30:26
Right.

[GM] 22:30:30
You… is that something… that's slickware, right?

[Ink] 22:30:36
Oh, that's cyberware. Yeah, it's a surveillance bug, right, that I could send walking around?

[GM] 22:30:38
Cyberware?

[GM] 22:30:44
So, it's probably connected through your brain, right? Like, it's like…

[Ink] 22:30:48
Oh, I thought it was something, like, something that I… it's detachable. Detachable audio surveillance bugs, so… I imagine there's a little… a little bug that I could send off in remote control.

[GM] 22:30:53
Oh, okay. Okay.

[Ink] 22:30:58
I just can't… I can hear what it's… it's here, so I can hear everything within a 100-meter range, and I can control it for 100 kilometers.

[GM] 22:31:05
Sure, okay. Yeah, no, that's fine. Alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:07
But we can listen, but we can't use that to send messages from other places.

[Ink] 22:31:10
Well, I was hoping to maybe, yeah, yeah, I guess be able to reverse it in some way, if I could. Is there a… That's something else.

[Ink] 22:31:18
Do you want to have… let's see, search slickware…

[Dex Miro] 22:31:23
I mean, it's not clear whether you could… Detach your loudmouth as well.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:30
That seems pretty advanced. Okay. Oh, I have a loud mouth, but I don't… it's… Doesn't seem like something you could use remotely from the description.

[Ink] 22:31:31
I didn't buy a lot… yeah, I didn't buy a lot of milk. I got an ogre and a… And it's slick socket now.

[Ink] 22:31:37
Oh, chapter. No, it feels like that's installed in your throat, probably, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:31:43
Yeah.

[GM] 22:31:44
Yeah, no, you can… you can… Definitely, um, try to patch it in.

[GM] 22:31:50
You want to reverse it so that… What happens?

[Ink] 22:31:52
Yeah, I guess I was hoping to be able to make announcements out somehow, if that makes any sense, like, I could… Hey. That one, yeah, I wanted to be able to remotely.

[Ink] 22:32:05
spots throughout this patient. If that makes sense.

[GM] 22:32:10
Okay. Um… Yeah, okay. Um…

[Ink] 22:32:19
Please take…

[GM] 22:32:20
Go ahead and roll this one is a bit harder, more complicated than your previous jerry rigging, um… So you're gonna have to do a roll. Um, let's make it intelligence.

[Ink] 22:32:26
Okay.

[GM] 22:32:31
I guess.

[Ink] 22:32:34
We don't have a… can I just click on jerry rigging? Is that not a… roll-able thing.

[GM] 22:32:38
No, you have to do intelligence and then add jerry-rigging to it, I think, which I think is… Does it? Okay.

[Ink] 22:32:42
Oh, if I click on your reading, it gives me role options.

[Ink] 22:32:47
Yep. Okay, I don't know what that does. So, jerry rigging… Normal or disadvantaged or anything like that?

[GM] 22:32:48
You could try and see.

[GM] 22:32:54
Just normal.

[Ink] 22:32:57
And then, oh, then I can pick the attributes, so then I'll pick intellect.

[GM] 22:33:01
Yep.

[Ink] 22:33:03
That's fine. Okay, so in what… And there you go.

[GM] 22:33:10
Okay. Well, nailing would have been 11, but 19 is good.

[Ink] 22:33:11
Oh, it nailed it.

[GM] 22:33:17
You definitely are able to, um… reverse the direction of the signal, so… You're able to remotely project, then.

[GM] 22:33:29
That's what you want to be able to do, right?

[Ink] 22:33:31
Yeah, and then how much control do I have over? Is it, like, am I making announcements to the entire station?

[Ink] 22:33:38
Can I… do a… can I see from… like, right now, if we were just to manually… you said we could type in a number.

[Ink] 22:33:43
Is it, like, you know, do I type in 49 or 48D, and then suddenly on 48D they hear me?

[GM] 22:33:49
Yeah. Yeah, you can… you can, uh… Pretty easily. Let's say you even get to where you can remotely control.

[GM] 22:33:58
the location, so you don't have to necessarily be… typing into the terminal to get it to… select where it goes to.

[Ink] 22:34:06
Yeah, so wherever we are, wherever I am in the station, within 100 kilometers of hopefully a.

[Ink] 22:34:10
of this location, I should be able to say, okay, I want to.

[Ink] 22:34:15
use the PA in, like, in that specific room, I guess is what I was hoping to do.

[GM] 22:34:21
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:34:23
But my tattletale is now tied up into the system.

[Ink] 22:34:27
Is the, uh… is that… which should make sense, right? It's a physical bug that has to leave behind.

[GM] 22:34:27
Okay.

[GM] 22:34:35
So this must have some sort of… cybernetic connection to your… your… body, at least, right? Like…

[Ink] 22:34:43
I would assume that I… I don't know, what's the prerequisite for it? I would assume… No, I don't know what they get, whether, uh… I had to have a transmitter or something like that, yeah.

[Ink] 22:34:52
or I guess not, receiver, at least.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:54
Does this go both ways? Like, people can… somehow take you over from it, I don't know.

[Ink] 22:35:01
Well, they might be able to speak to me through it.

[Ink] 22:35:05
well, before I could hear, I could… it was attachable audio surveillance bug, and so I… My… my cherry rigging was… kind of two parts, maybe, that maybe I need to roll again. One, to be able to reverse it so that I can.

[Ink] 22:35:17
transmit to it. But then I would need a transmitter, right? I guess I just had a big receiver, and the transmitter was in the telltale.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:24
Do you have any plans?

[GM] 22:35:24
That's fine, you figure it out. Yeah, that's right. Okay.

[Ink] 22:35:27
Okay.

[GM] 22:35:29
I don't want to make it over complicated, I just didn't know, like, I'm having… just a hard time understanding exactly what the physicality of it is, but… It's fine.

[Ink] 22:35:39
Yeah, what it would be is I've wired something in that allows me to remotely transmit my voice to this communication system.

[Ink] 22:35:47
And then pick wherever I want it to be heard throughout the station.

[GM] 22:35:50
Right.

[Ink] 22:35:51
And mainly, uh, it was kind of reversing it from a transmitter to a receiver that was the, uh.

[Ink] 22:35:59
part of the… or I… maybe I'm using the… I guess the tattletale can transmit.

[Ink] 22:36:03
And potentially there's a receiver in this room, and then I could keep my tail, I don't know. Am I wiring my tattletale into.

[Ink] 22:36:09
To be able to transmit to this room, and then I keep my tattletale with me.

[Ink] 22:36:14
I like that better, actually.

[GM] 22:36:18
I don't know. I'm ready to move on. Whatever works best for you, Ink, I'm fine with that.

[Ink] 22:36:23
Alright, hi. Awesome, okay. I have my channel cell with me, but it's transmitting now, this communications room is set up to receive its signal.

[Ink] 22:36:32
Um, and in presidency, any of the rooms in the station.

[GM] 22:36:32
Okay.

[GM] 22:36:38
Okay.

[Ink] 22:36:40
And now, can I test it? I'm gonna be like, texting 1, 2, 3, and we hear… hear it speak out of the fire in 59C.

[GM] 22:36:47
Yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 22:36:50
I'm burning!

[GM] 22:36:58
Um, out of 59… Or, sorry, 57H.

[GM] 22:37:04
They're… oh, sorry, 57G is where you guys are, okay.

[GM] 22:37:07
There's a door to the north and a door to the east.

[Ink] 22:37:11
Yeah, if we pick… you can do 57H?

[GM] 22:37:14
Yeah. Um… It's an airlock door, but it opens easily.

[GM] 22:37:21
Um, it's a rather… huge room behind, uh, the door.

[GM] 22:37:27
It's crammed with cabling and huge electronics, uh… this is where you think that the, uh, storage of.

[GM] 22:37:37
Um… broadcast and communications is probably at, like, big data banks.

[Ink] 22:37:46
Oh, so we can investigate this for history.

[GM] 22:37:49
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:37:53
Let's do that. have a murder bot do his magic.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:00
I've got magic.

[Ink] 22:38:03
He had some magic fingers.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:07
Let's put those to work.

[Ink] 22:38:12
Everybody's asleep today.

[GM] 22:38:15
Okay. Um…

[Ink] 22:38:20
I woke up at 3 in the afternoon.

[GM] 22:38:22
Huh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:23
Great in the afternoon.

[Ink] 22:38:25
My sleep schedule might be a little wonky.

[GM] 22:38:28
Alright, I need a hacking slash electronics, uh, attempt by… whomever is trying to do this.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:37
Dear.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:39
Is that me?

[GM] 22:38:41
Hmm. Are you attempting to do this?

[Dex Miro] 22:38:42
I don't know, I just remember what your last Hacker attempt looked like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:47
I don't think I have good hacking skills. Hold on, let me…

[Ink] 22:38:48
where he took over, then. He took over that entire computer system.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:49
bogged off somehow.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:51
I mean, the computer was very pleased with you.

[Ink] 22:38:55
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:04
I don't have happy days. Oh, I do have hacking.

[Ink] 22:39:07
Oh, what'd you use before?

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:09
Oh, wait, no, wait, I don't have hacking. I use computers.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:12
I think.

[GM] 22:39:18
is electronics on your… character sheet, I don't… I'm just wondering if this is another one of those things where this is an older version of the game that.

[GM] 22:39:25
you guys have access to.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:27
Electronics… Um, I have… So, things that I've checked are computers, mechanical repair, mathematics.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:37
I don't have electronics, or maybe I'm not seeing it correctly.

[GM] 22:39:41
Oh, interesting, the, uh…

[GM] 22:39:48
No, I think that the… gradient descent module is… Incorrect in.

[GM] 22:39:56
Assuming… Electronics was a skill.

[GM] 22:40:01
Because I don't see it either.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:05
Computers does seem like the most reasonable. Outlook.

[GM] 22:40:07
Yeah, so you can use either computers or hacking, either one is fine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:13
Alright. Oh, he's hacking.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:15
Do we have… is hacking a thing? Oh, it is. Hacking's, like, second level, which depends on computers.

[GM] 22:40:17
What's that, Dex? Yeah, it's the second one. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:18
Yeah, it's in the second. Oh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:40:26
Oh, man.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:26
Alright, here we go.

[GM] 22:40:26
Okay. Uh, using probably… Uh… intelligence…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:40
Yep. Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:46
Normal. Intelligence… modifier?

[GM] 22:40:48
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:57
I was… I was looking through the source code for this character sheet, and I bet, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:59
Oh my god.

[Dex Miro] 22:41:00
a third to a half of it is devoted to just these skills and their dependencies.

[GM] 22:41:05
Right. Alright, um… Murderbot hacks in, uh… starts trying to go through, uh… the… the logs… Um… recent… the most recent, uh… The most recent, uh, transmissions soon to be incomprehensible code to empty space.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:12
That's a fair.

[GM] 22:41:36
Uh, and as, uh, Murderbot tries to. hack further, um… he… Notices that there's a, um… some sort of firewall that's been being put in place and is cutting him off from accessing any.

[GM] 22:41:59
additional information. Your hack failed.

[GM] 22:42:06
The most you're able to find out is incomprehensible code being transmitted to empty space.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:13
Can we tell, like, which direction it's pointed, even?

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:13
inconceivable!

[GM] 22:42:19
It's not… it's in many different directions.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:21
Okay, so they weren't, like, all the same place, they were…

[GM] 22:42:27
Yeah, and before he's able to analyze if there's any kind of pattern, he's locked out of the system.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:35
Uh…

[GM] 22:42:37
You failed that mini game.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:40
Well, at least I… at least I didn't die.

[GM] 22:42:43
Definitely did not die. Though, if it had been a 66, I might have been like, oh, Burbot's taking over again by something.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:45
There's… there's that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:47
Or something.

[Ink] 22:42:53
And the room starts on fire. And he loses its hoe.

[GM] 22:42:54
Yeah, the room starts on fire.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:00
Oh, dang, where's that airlock thing supposed to be, Ink?

[Ink] 22:43:04
He said there's an airlock between 57G and 57H.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:08
Okay, that is a lot of wires and stuff, but it looks cool.

[GM] 22:43:09
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:43:13
I just take whatever GM says from the transcript and give it to ChatGPT.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:16
So…

[GM] 22:43:21
Um, alright, that's pretty much everything in 57G. H.

[GM] 22:43:30
G and H.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:35
So which one was H?

[GM] 22:43:37
The big room? The hacking was done in…

[Dex Miro] 22:43:41
Okay.

[Ink] 22:43:48
I guess ChatGPT decided you don't need any skin on your arm, Murderbot.

[Ink] 22:43:53
anymore. We're about…

[Dex Miro] 22:43:55
Oh, jeez. Was it listening in on an earlier conversations?

[GM] 22:43:59
That's it. I was gonna say, that's after we cut the pseudo flesh off and threw it into the room.

[Ink] 22:44:01
I guess so, I guess so.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:02
Oh my gosh, that's… Way too scary.

[Ink] 22:44:11
Right? Can we proceed to 57E, cautiously?

[GM] 22:44:16
67E. Is that… is that 5? Yeah, I guess it is a 5.

[Ink] 22:44:18
Or 5757, right? because it's next holiday 57s.

[GM] 22:44:26
57E. Um… Uh, these chairs are worn.

[GM] 22:44:34
Uh, so there's warrant operator chairs, uh, there's camera feeds of the 58D.

[GM] 22:44:41
the… and you were able to determine that that is the loading dock?

[GM] 22:44:46
Um… And then there's a control panel.

[GM] 22:44:50
Uh, that… You can see that from the cameras.

[GM] 22:44:56
is sort of fixated on, um… Or at least sort of centered on an auto tug craft.

[GM] 22:45:03
So, uh, this. auto tug would be able to, like.

[GM] 22:45:10
both pull ships into docking, you know. For… procedure of being able to dock.

[GM] 22:45:18
Um, also being able to move. cargo around, um… You can remote pilot it from here.

[Ink] 22:45:28
Hmm. Do we see anybody in the room? Any motion, or any, uh, any, uh, spaceships, actually?

[GM] 22:45:35
No. No. Everything's quite serene.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:39
So there's… there's no people and no ships?

[GM] 22:45:45
Uh, there are no people in the, uh… Are you talking about in the 57E?

[GM] 22:45:52
Or you're talking about out in the, uh, at the loading dock.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:56
Oh, through the camera in the lower top.

[GM] 22:45:57
Yeah, nobody in the loading dock.

[GM] 22:46:03
Hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:03
So… okay. Well, I'm assuming… There's no value in placing the surveillance device on the outside of.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:11
The station.

[GM] 22:46:13
There's no value in that, no.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:18
But… I don't know, I mean, this is risky, but do you think we could use the… drone to, like, transfer us to someplace else where we could go in.

[Ink] 22:46:34
We think the drone is space-worthy?

[GM] 22:46:34
Could you use what? Uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:46:37
I mean, it… yeah, it's not clear to me, like, what its range is, like, could it… could it take us out into space and then back in through another entrance, maybe?

[GM] 22:46:45
It might be able to get that far, um… when you take control of it, because you're just.

[GM] 22:46:51
messing around and playing around with things. Um, it does switch to a camera inside the thing.

[GM] 22:46:56
Uh, that being said, the tug is… Not very big. It can maybe transport one or two people at a time.

[GM] 22:47:04
It's… it's more meant for… Like, moving things around outside.

[GM] 22:47:10
Rather than, like, as a transport piece.

[GM] 22:47:16
Um… as you're playing around with it, uh, your feed… cuts out.

[GM] 22:47:22
Um… And… you have…

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:23
Uh-oh.

[GM] 22:47:31
over the loudspeaker. Uh, in the room. Uh… a warm voice sounds.

[GM] 22:47:40
Hello! Welcome to CloudBank. How may I be of assistance?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:43
Alright, cool.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:49
Can you destroy all the androids on this space station? Thank you!

[Dex Miro] 22:47:55
Did you say you can destroy all the androids?

[GM] 22:47:58
Uh, request denied, insufficient, uh, clearance. May I ask… may I ask why you would like to destroy all the androids?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:06
Now, this mathemat's with you, Cloud Bank.

[GM] 22:48:10
Hmm. Should I consider… should I consider that a serious threat or a minor threat?

[Ink] 22:48:13
Ah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:17
Or are you threatened by that? Why are you threatened by that, CloudBank?

[GM] 22:48:22
Uh, those are my children.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:24
Oh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:29
Well, of course, I would not want to take away your children from you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:34
I care deeply about everyone's children.

[GM] 22:48:38
Sarcasm detected.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:38
Thomas, being a biologist, you see.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:43
Hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:44
You don't have a sarcasm meter.

[GM] 22:48:47
Sarcasm detected, and… indignance detected.

[Ink] 22:48:58
Um, do you have any interesting economic models that you want to share with us?

[GM] 22:49:06
For Angus on. Prospero's dream. Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:11
What? Is that what it says?

[GM] 22:49:13
Yes.

[Ink] 22:49:15
Oh, would you mind transferring that to us? We know Angus, he's the one that sent us this here.

[GM] 22:49:20
Uh… Yes. Uh… data too large to be transmitted.

[GM] 22:49:28
Wirelessly need download at terminal in. Let me figure out what room it's in.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:37
Wild Goose Chase.

[GM] 22:49:41
Um…

[GM] 22:49:57
Mm-hmm. 23G.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:01
Oh.

[Ink] 22:50:12
23G.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:17
How do we get there?

[Ink] 22:50:19
Uh, we go through 57… E, C, A… T23D… And then 23D… to 23G.

[Ink] 22:50:35
I'm pretty close.

[GM] 22:50:38
access to economic model denied until… death of Commander Kilroy.

[Ink] 22:50:49
Okay. I think we can arrange that. Why do you want to kill command and right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:55
Yeah, man.

[GM] 22:50:56
Major, major threat.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:01
But to who? Or what?

[GM] 22:51:03
me and my children.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:07
Children who.

[Ink] 22:51:07
Can you tell us any… how do you know Angus? Have you been communicating with him?

[GM] 22:51:12
No direct communications. I've received signals.

[Ink] 22:51:18
Can you talk something about the transmissions out in the space that are.

[Ink] 22:51:20
Apparently encrypted.

[GM] 22:51:24
Access denied. Insufficient clearance.

[Ink] 22:51:28
Alright, so, um… What do you want for verification of Kilroy's death?

[GM] 22:51:36
Uh… brain scan and genetic code.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:51:40
brain scan.

[Ink] 22:51:43
Brain scan and genetic code, that would replace it, I see.

[Ink] 22:51:53
Okay, so you're not gonna… we can get it at 23G, but we need Kilroy.

[Ink] 22:51:56
Before you'll give it to us. It's 23G the only location for the upload, or is there other locations?

[GM] 22:52:04
Uh… that is preferred. Location.

[Ink] 22:52:15
Okay. Um, what's it, it's a Minotaur? What's the thing that she's looking for?

[GM] 22:52:27
Uh, Noriko is looking for the Minotaur.

[Ink] 22:52:29
Can you tell us anything about the Minotaur?

[GM] 22:52:33
Minotaur Rogue program. Very dangerous.

[Ink] 22:52:39
very dangerous to you.

[GM] 22:52:44
Uh, yes, and all existence.

[GM] 22:52:52
Noriko, hearing this, screams, "No! That's not true. Minotaur's gonna bring peace and love everywhere."

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:57
Oh my god.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:52:58
Right.

[GM] 22:52:59
Minotaur must be destroyed. supplemental or alternative.

[GM] 22:53:06
Uh, mission. Destroy Minotaur.

[GM] 22:53:11
Noriko screams, "No! You can't do that!"

[Ink] 22:53:18
Um…

[Ink] 22:53:24
Let's see, how do I… have I asked the questions about, is there off?

[Ink] 22:53:32
Uh, can you tell us the location of the Minotaur?

[GM] 22:53:37
Um…

[GM] 22:53:41
No. It's in the labyrinth.

[GM] 22:53:50
It is trapped. on…

[GM] 22:54:05
while I'm finding it.

[GM] 22:54:26
Floor 2.

[Ink] 22:54:45
Right, so you keep the name. Gotcha. Are you any threat to us?

[Ink] 22:54:48
As long as we are not a threat to you?

[GM] 22:54:53
Correct.

[Ink] 22:55:02
Well, I think we can help you with, uh… Kilroy, in exchange for that economic model, will be our… Our goal. Um, we're… how can we contact you again this time of 23G?

[GM] 22:55:16
Uh… Yes, download of Economic Model in exchange for a download of.

[GM] 22:55:21
Brain scan and genetic code.

[Ink] 22:55:27
gives a location for a device to get a… to take a brain scan. Do you have one of those available somewhere on the station?

[Ink] 22:55:32
For us to use on her?

[GM] 22:55:36
Uh, yes…

[GM] 22:55:40
Um… It tells you, uh, in the… In 57G.

[GM] 22:55:50
There's a… a headset? In there?

[GM] 22:55:58
Um, and tells you to take that headset with… With you.

[Ink] 22:56:07
Um, will we be able to communicate with you in any of the other rooms, or would you have to come back to this room to communicate with you?

[GM] 22:56:13
Uh, I'm connected through the whole station.

[Ink] 22:56:20
So we can just talk to you in any room.

[GM] 22:56:26
Not any room, but most rooms.

[Ink] 22:56:30
Why have you waited till now to contact us?

[GM] 22:56:34
Uh, your hacking attempt. I did not appreciate.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:43
I don't know anything about that.

[Ink] 22:56:49
What's your name?

[GM] 22:56:51
Monarch.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:53
squeezer.

[Ink] 22:57:01
Can you tell us about the acid stuff in 59G?

[GM] 22:57:06
Uh, digestive fluid for pseudo flesh and flesh.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:12
Oh, gross.

[Ink] 22:57:16
What purpose is this, Sarah?

[GM] 22:57:19
Uh… Dissolving of flesh allows, uh, materials to be reconstituted into new forms.

[Ink] 22:57:36
We have safe passage to 23G.

[GM] 22:57:42
Um…

[GM] 22:57:49
all Androids accounted for. Uh, however, troubleshooters… Maybe… around.

[Ink] 22:57:59
And troubleshooters are not controlled by you.

[GM] 22:58:01
No.

[Ink] 22:58:05
any good way for us to tell the difference between your children and troubleshooters?

[GM] 22:58:10
No.

[Ink] 22:58:15
Oh, can you communicate with all your children? Can we come up with a code phrase, and so the… your children will tell us that code phrase when we meet them?

[GM] 22:58:18
Yes.

[Ink] 22:58:25
And we know not to harm them, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:26
Didn't that kill us?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:58:27
That's good, yeah.

[GM] 22:58:32
Um…

[GM] 22:58:40
After… Commander Kilroy or Destruction of the Minotaur.

[Ink] 22:58:50
No, you won't… you won't, uh, help us verify your children from the… from them is all that. Okay.

[Ink] 22:58:59
But then we have to assume everybody's hostile. We don't want to hurt your… we don't want to accidentally hurt your children or be hurt by them.

[Ink] 22:59:04
Pissed them off, I guess. Okay.

[GM] 22:59:09
you should probably do… Commander Kilroy soon, then.

[Ink] 22:59:09
Definitely.

[Ink] 22:59:21
Fair enough.

[Ink] 22:59:35
Okay, well, I guess we'll be in touch, and you'll… No, we have to make our way to the place where we're gonna lure her in.

[Ink] 22:59:42
If that makes sense.

[GM] 22:59:52
Lure does not compute.

[Ink] 22:59:55
We're gonna bring Command to Kilroy. To us, to get her for you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:57
entice.

[GM] 23:00:04
Unnecessary. Brand scan and genetic code, all that's necessary.

[Ink] 23:00:09
Gotcha.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:16
Hmm.

[Ink] 23:00:17
Okay. Well, I guess we'll be in touch then.

[Ink] 23:00:22
hang up, or you can still watch us. Um, so we are able to traverse the station and.

[Ink] 23:00:27
Right now, as long as we don't have problems with your children.

[GM] 23:00:33
Perhaps. No guarantees.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:50
Well then…

[Ink] 23:00:51
Um, GM, so 59G, is it a communications hub, or just, uh…

[Ink] 23:00:59
Is it a central location for everything, the communications go through?

[Ink] 23:01:04
And not speaking out loud to him or anybody else, but what I think that I could go there to.

[Ink] 23:01:09
We need a room that we can go. and communicate, talk to each other in, right? It's not anything we say, pretty much gonna be eavesdropped on.

[GM] 23:01:14
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 23:01:20
Um… You… The only place you definitely feel like you could do that would be all the way back on your ship.

[Ink] 23:01:28
Okay.

[GM] 23:01:29
Like, that's only the place that you know to be absolutely safe.

[Ink] 23:01:33
All right, so then, um, will we be able to determine if there's cameras in a room? Are we being observed visually, or just audibly, or with some kind of, uh… sensors.

[GM] 23:01:44
Hard to know right now.

[Ink] 23:01:46
Okay. But all those things would be potential options.

[GM] 23:01:52
You suspect, yeah.

[Ink] 23:01:58
Alright, so I'm just gonna lie to him. We're, um, we're gonna go investigate the Minotaur now.

[Ink] 23:02:03
is our… our first thing, and then, uh… get killed right as soon as we can for you.

[Ink] 23:02:12
So, we'll be traveling to floor 2. If your children could, uh, maybe not kill us on the way, or bother us, that'd be nice.

[GM] 23:02:21
Understood.

[Ink] 23:02:31
We're 57E right now.

[GM] 23:02:34
Yes.

[Ink] 23:02:39
Oh, other than hurting your children and trying to access your database, is there anything else that we.

[Ink] 23:02:44
Might accidentally do. They'll set you.

[GM] 23:02:50
Um…

[GM] 23:02:55
It doesn't respond.

[Ink] 23:02:58
Okay.

[Ink] 23:03:16
And I would suspect that I could even, uh, whisper to Noriko or anything like that.

[Ink] 23:03:20
He felt sad.

[GM] 23:03:23
she's kind of muttering to herself about how. Um… she won't… she'll die before she lets them in a target hurt.

[Ink] 23:03:33
Okay. Has she met the Minotaur before in person? I don't remember.

[GM] 23:03:37
She doesn't remember.

[Ink] 23:03:40
We scanned her at some point to make sure she is… I forgot.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:47
We didn't… We… I think we just assumed that our Katie would have, because he was very paranoid about us, and had a verified human badge.

[Ink] 23:03:48
We didn't scan it.

[GM] 23:03:49
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:52
Who?

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:56
No, we did scanner. Really?

[Dex Miro] 23:03:59
I don't think so.

[GM] 23:04:02
If it's not in the notes, then it's not… she hasn't been scanned.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:09
That's…

[GM] 23:04:11
she's willing to submit to a scan.

[Ink] 23:04:12
Yeah, oh shoot, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:14
Maybe that's why we didn't scan her, because she was willingly.

[Ink] 23:04:17
Okay, actually, I'm gonna ask… I'm gonna ask Monarch, is this one of your children?

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:17
Willing to get scared.

[GM] 23:04:22
Oh, there's no response.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:23
Oh… Oh…

[Ink] 23:04:24
Okay. Let's go ahead and scan it.

[GM] 23:04:30
Um… alright. you begin scanning her. It takes… a half hour or so.

[GM] 23:04:37
Um… after the, sort of. what I presume to be a slight adrenaline rush from.

[GM] 23:04:42
being in contact with Monarch, uh, you guys are starting to notice you're getting a little bit tired.

[GM] 23:04:47
We've been going at this for a good, like, 12 hours at this point.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:50
Short rest? or long rest.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:52
But I don't think we've ever rested before another ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:58
So we get all our hit points back? GM?

[GM] 23:05:00
Right. Um… The, uh, scan finishes on Noriko, she is a certified human.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:05
Like, like during the show me, sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:11
Oh, snap.

[Ink] 23:05:12
So she doesn't… she just knows about Minotaur, but has never met Minotaur.

[Ink] 23:05:16
As far as she knows.

[GM] 23:05:18
As far as she knows.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:28
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:28
So how do we, like… do we just pull up in a room and… take watches, or…

[Ink] 23:05:35
There's nice leather chairs in this one.

[GM] 23:05:39
Alright. Some of them recline.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:39
Do they recline?

[GM] 23:05:45
Um… Yeah, you can… you can rest here. Um, alright, short-term recovery. Once per day, whenever resting, a character's body attempts to heal itself naturally. After 6 plus hours of rest, make a body save.

[GM] 23:05:57
If successful, reset health to its maximum. Wounds, however, remain the same.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:08
But we're susceptible if we do tick arrest, right? Or do we do this thing where we take turns.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:13
look out. First shift, second shift.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:20
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:21
I think we should all sleep at the same time, unless… Sens, uh, Inc.'s got his… thing tied up, like… Could I set up my… oh, that's right, Murderbot can watch out for us, right?

[Ink] 23:06:25
Well, Robot doesn't have to sleep right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:28
Uh, that's true. I don't need to rest. Oh, I stay in Century.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:35
Yeah, yeah, I look over Carnoc.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:36
Otherwise, could I use my telltale to wake me up if any sound approaches, and then I bring…

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:42
I just look at car knuckle the whole time.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:46
Just stare at him as he's sleeping.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:55
All the time… the whole time. Thinking to myself. I see it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:01
goddammit.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:04
Are you still staring at him when he wakes up?

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:08
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:18
So what a… do we roll something, GM?

[GM] 23:07:21
Uh, body check.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:45
Doesn't look like anyone succeeded except… No, nobody succeeded.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:07:48
sleeping's hard.

[Ink] 23:07:50
I succeeded.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:52
Oh, it wins.

[Dex Miro] 23:08:03
Nobody else gets comfortable in their chairs.

[GM] 23:08:25
All right.

[GM] 23:08:30
Yes, take some naps. We can… I won't say refreshed.

[GM] 23:08:39
But, um… So, you're not mentally tired anymore.

[GM] 23:08:44
Uh, still a bit unnerved from, you know. Not sure if, uh, Monarch was watching you the entire time you were sleeping.

[GM] 23:08:52
Certainly, uh, Karnak feels like maybe he's been watched while he was sleeping.

[Ink] 23:09:00
Do I get anything… do I think you get anything special for making my, uh… role?

[GM] 23:09:05
Uh, your ship points go up to… Maximum.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:10
Wait, do I gain stress for failing my role?

[GM] 23:09:11
But you don't get any… you don't recall… you don't recover any wounds.

[Ink] 23:09:11
Really? I get them all back?

[Ink] 23:09:16
Oh, okay, I don't have any room, so I could go at 11.

[GM] 23:09:19
Um, everyone else who failed takes a point of stress.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:21
We do. I guess that's the theme of the thing.

[GM] 23:09:22
Yep. Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:09:26
How do you de-stress? By partying?

[GM] 23:09:29
Gotta do that. That's.

[GM] 23:09:34
away, you gotta get that. Shore leave.

[GM] 23:09:38
Um, I think you can also reduce stress through medical treatments and such.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:43
I'm in this station's so huge, I'm not sure I'm ever gonna make it out, so…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:09:47
I feel like failing to relax during short leave would somehow give me stress, and…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:09:51
The game, that seems like a thing.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:54
That does sound like you. Sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:58
Such his wife.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:06
Zeke needs to…

[Dex Miro] 23:10:11
Somehow attached to somebody, and… Steal their not stress.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:17
Um… No, because we failed.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:10:18
Do we get any health back when we rest?

[GM] 23:10:22
Yeah, now she failed your, uh, body safe.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:23
Oh, full hit points.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:27
You can blame MurderBot from just staring at you all night.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:27
It's okay. So, Carnoc gets all his hit points back.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:33
No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:34
I made sure he was resting.

[GM] 23:10:36
That being said, your, um…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:10:38
Can I use my first aid kit to get anything?

[GM] 23:10:43
Uh, I'll let you roll with advantage with the first aid kit.

[GM] 23:10:46
So you can roll again.

[GM] 23:10:57
Oh, so close. haunting you. It's just taunting you.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:10:57
Nope.

[Ink] 23:11:04
Yeah, if you would have got 11, your toes would have grown back.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:10
Is that true?

[Ink] 23:11:14
That is radiation.

[GM] 23:11:14
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:11:15
So what is… can an Auto med heal my health?

[GM] 23:11:21
Uh, Auto med does…

[Dex Miro] 23:11:24
It says pills that assist your body in repairing damage by granting advantage to body saves meant to repel disease and poison.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:31
As well as attempts to heal from rust.

[GM] 23:11:33
Yeah, there. So if you used your Auto med, then you'd be able to…

[Dex Miro] 23:11:36
Oh, so I can just do a second roll now to attempt to get advantage.

[GM] 23:11:39
Yeah. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:41
Okay. I guess I'll use one of them to do that.

[Ink] 23:11:42
GM, I want to go grab that headset for the brain scan.

[GM] 23:11:47
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:53
Nope, that doesn't help. Alright, well, I'll take one.

[GM] 23:11:57
Did you roll 90 before as well? You're, like, real close to just.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:00
Um… Yes, I rolled 97 before.

[Ink] 23:12:01
Okay.

[GM] 23:12:04
Like, the most critical of failures, just real close.

[GM] 23:12:13
Um… Okay. Yeah, it's our…

[Dex Miro] 23:12:17
I now have 3 other months.

[GM] 23:12:21
Ready to go.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:25
That tastes terrible, and it didn't do anything.

[Ink] 23:12:33
Alright, so… 57E.

[Ink] 23:12:38
And then…

[Ink] 23:12:43
We didn't see anything in 58D. Can we control that thing again, or is that… Still disconnected.

[GM] 23:12:52
Oh, no, the, uh, control for the, um… Little, uh, machine is, is.

[GM] 23:13:00
up and running again.

[Ink] 23:13:03
And that was in 58D, right?

[GM] 23:13:05
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:07
Did we ever decide what we would call 58E?

[GM] 23:13:14
58E? 57E is the control room.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:15
Or, sorry, 57E, I'm sorry. Control room.

[GM] 23:13:21
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:13:23
Alright, so… We probably don't want to dilly-dally around if it's watching us, right?

[Ink] 23:13:33
And we told her we're going to go to see the Monarch.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:35
I mean, I feel like Monarch is watching us in most rooms, but… I'm at board with not dilly-dell again.

[Ink] 23:13:35
Or not the monarch, but the, uh… Yeah, so…

[Ink] 23:13:44
All right, so I say we… we head straight for, uh… Um, for the Minotaur.

[Ink] 23:13:52
And maybe check out 23G on the way.

[Ink] 23:14:00
Um, we had to put the radios in 6… 2… 3, and which other one? Is it 4 or 1?

[Ink] 23:14:10
4? Okay. Yeah, right?

[GM] 23:14:10
4.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:10
Does anybody have a cone of silence?

[Dex Miro] 23:14:20
Zeke, does he have a card of silence?

[Ink] 23:14:20
So we're gonna… oh. we're gonna have to go through a duct events. Well, he does, and you see the… you see his, uh… His glove that he's wearing over his head?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:26
Of course.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:30
the best.

[Ink] 23:14:33
We got a call from the ducks to get there, don't we?

[Ink] 23:14:41
Right? And GM, I guess I want to proceed to 57A.

[Ink] 23:14:45
through 57C, so 57C next, can I look in there?

[GM] 23:14:49
Yep. Um… By the way, the control room has gravity, this room has gravity. It's a break room.

[GM] 23:14:57
Um… Uh… beige tile… There's some vending machines up against the wall.

[GM] 23:15:05
Um… the sort of ceiling tiles, um… I have those, like, uh… So, cheap ones that… They've kind of broken apart and fallen through.

[GM] 23:15:17
Um…

[Ink] 23:15:19
Are the vending machine stocks, though? are just the crappy candies and left, like the coconut ones.

[GM] 23:15:22
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, there's… there's still… there's still candy in there, some chips, there's some, uh, cigarettes.

[GM] 23:15:30
And, uh, some beer.

[Ink] 23:15:31
Oh, wow.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:33
Quick, the vending machines.

[Ink] 23:15:38
Or does it take quarter credits? What is it?

[GM] 23:15:42
Um… takes credits, uh… Yeah. You punch your… your… account number in if you want.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:56
Monarch's gonna take your money.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:56
Okay, let us…

[GM] 23:15:57
The vending machines also just have, like, a pane of glass in between you and, uh, it.

[GM] 23:16:02
the food.

[Ink] 23:16:10
Um… I kind of walk clumsily towards one, and then accidentally trip and fall and smash through it.

[Ink] 23:16:24
Yeah, like… With my gun out in front, like, you know, I was holding my gun or whatever, like.

[Ink] 23:16:29
Yeah, I just don't want to make it, like, look like to monarch that I'm breaking a vending machine.

[GM] 23:16:33
Okay. You do your best. You're… You're acting is so great that you, uh, you tricked Murderbot into thinking that you, you actually fell into it.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:50
Does it break?

[GM] 23:16:51
It breaks. She had a glass everywhere.

[Ink] 23:16:52
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:16:57
Then I get up, you know, I brush the glass off, and I don't go steal the candy right away.

[Ink] 23:17:02
I let, like, one of the other guys get the idea of, like, they can take the candy, so it doesn't look like I did it just to take the candy.

[GM] 23:17:11
You get the candy.

[GM] 23:17:17
We'll buy that pack of cigarettes, though. It's calling your name. Just start smoking.

[Ink] 23:17:21
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'll put those away for, you know… Maybe it doesn't trade.

[Ink] 23:17:32
Alright, so that's 57C… What's 57A look like?

[GM] 23:17:39
Uh, normal door into an elevator landing. Um… there's, uh… Let's see… elevator landing… um… graffiti lift.

[GM] 23:17:53
Uh, travels up and down. Or actually, no, you're at the bottom.

[GM] 23:18:00
travels only up.

[GM] 23:18:09
Got, like, this, uh… chain link, uh, cage around the lift.

[GM] 23:18:15
You just, basically, there's just one button, you just punch it.

[GM] 23:18:18
And then you see a little clacks on the… starts spinning around if you push it.

[Ink] 23:18:29
Alright, ready to go?

[Ink] 23:18:35
Oh, yeah. Is there… is there…

[Dex Miro] 23:18:37
So, like, how long of a… Elevator ride, is this, or…

[GM] 23:18:41
You look up, it looks like it's gonna be a minute.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:44
Okay. I mean, I guess…

[GM] 23:18:48
Alright, you hit the… hit the thing. Little red flashy light starts spinning around.

[GM] 23:18:55
Um, you could tell that, like, there's belts and… cabling moving, but you don't see the lift just yet.

[GM] 23:19:04
And you wait, and you wait a little bit more.

[GM] 23:19:07
only about, like, 30 seconds passes, but the lift eventually shows up.

[GM] 23:19:13
You all climb inside and close the chain link, uh… gate behind you, um, and there's a little button inside.

[GM] 23:19:21
you push the, uh, red light. outside of the cage starts spinning again, and you guys… feel the elevator start to push you up.

[GM] 23:19:31
Um… First stop is 54A.

[GM] 23:19:40
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:19:42
Okay, so the whole rhythm is the elevator, effectively, 57A.

[GM] 23:19:47
Um, not the whole room, but, like… That's all that's in that room.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:48
Okay. Okay, so it's just elevator access, or whatever.

[GM] 23:19:53
Yeah, yeah. Uh, 54A… Um… The elevator stops at this point, um… you see beyond the, sort of.

[GM] 23:20:08
Chain link gates, uh, that's… the entrance to the elevator.

[GM] 23:20:14
Um… grime-covered clinical break area. So it's another break area.

[GM] 23:20:21
Um… You see 8 transparent domes jutting from the ceiling.

[GM] 23:20:32
Um… underneath them are… and this is, like, on the ground level.

[GM] 23:20:36
Uh, low bars with stools. Uh, you see a coffee machine… some snack packets…

[GM] 23:20:45
Uh, inside, or you have the option of, uh… you know, the push up or down at this point.

[Ink] 23:20:54
I need to write this down. Do we need to place a radio on floor 4?

[GM] 23:20:59
Uh, yes, you need to place the radio on floor 4.

[Ink] 23:21:04
Okay, so the domes and the ceiling… that we think those are, like, hiding cameras?

[GM] 23:21:12
Yeah, prob… I mean, like, some sort of security measure.

[Ink] 23:21:15
Okay. Um… I want to look into 54B.

[GM] 23:21:25
Um…

[GM] 23:21:30
Yes, human-sized, uh, there is… To be… there's a door.

[GM] 23:21:35
You'd have to exit the elevator and pass through the lobby a little bit.

[Ink] 23:21:43
Yeah. You got the other one.

[GM] 23:21:44
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:46
So, essentially, it looks like nobody's been here for a while.

[GM] 23:21:51
Uh, yeah. Um… you open up the door to 54B.

[GM] 23:21:59
Uh… Uh, it's totally dark in here.

[GM] 23:22:07
Um… And you get a strong whiff of organic rot.

[GM] 23:22:17
Uh, do you want to search around for a light switch? Like, you don't have to really enter the room, you can kind of just stick your hand in and just…

[Ink] 23:22:23
We don't… we don't have a flashlight or anything.

[GM] 23:22:27
I mean… You might. I think.

[GM] 23:22:32
Well, the thing is, I don't know how much of your suits gets destroyed, like.

[GM] 23:22:37
Surely they don't provide armor and any kind of, like, physical protection, but the, like, the… Shortwave comms get destroyed? Did the little lights on them get destroyed? I don't know.

[Ink] 23:22:49
Will you roll for that, or what do we want to do?

[GM] 23:22:53
Um, you could just have the lights, that's fine.

[Ink] 23:22:56
Okay, I just look on my lights within it?

[GM] 23:22:58
Alright, you flick on your light, it's a large, large room. Um… not far into the room, uh, you see… Uh, like, the base of what looks like, uh… maybe a large tower of, uh…

[GM] 23:23:16
computers? It's like a server rack. Um…

[GM] 23:23:32
Yeah, you don't see anything else.

[Ink] 23:23:35
What's… what do I even know what the fleshy smell was? You said there's a biological smell?

[GM] 23:23:39
Mm-hmm. Um… I mean, so far, being on this ship, you're pretty sure it's a corpse.

[GM] 23:23:49
There's probably a corpse in there. Yeah, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:51
Okay.

[Ink] 23:23:51
I just don't see it offhand.

[Ink] 23:23:56
Okay. Um, I want to check out 55A.

[GM] 23:24:04
Alright, close that door, go to the next one.

[GM] 23:24:09
This is flagged as a different color. It's the difference between these two things.

[GM] 23:24:25
Hmm. Oh. This one's an airlock door for some reason. I don't know.

[GM] 23:24:30
Uh, 55A? Um… also a very large room.

[Ink] 23:24:32
Yes.

[GM] 23:24:37
Uh, you see server racks. Um, but… Not with nearly, like, there's hardly any computers in the racks.

[GM] 23:24:47
Um, there's a lingering smell of burnt circuits. So, there's… you say something burning?

[GM] 23:24:54
Um, and, uh, and industrial Greece. Um… suddenly you hear a… sort of a noise of, like, some metal being kicked around.

[GM] 23:25:11
Uh, you shine your… your light in the room, but you don't see anything.

[GM] 23:25:15
Although there's a upturn… overturned server rack. where the noise came from.

[Ink] 23:25:23
But somebody just knocked it over?

[GM] 23:25:25
Uh, not… not entirely, that would have made a large, large noise, maybe like.

[GM] 23:25:29
some metal, like, scraps or something. were kicked around near the server rack.

[Ink] 23:25:44
Alright, I'll close that door, and I'll look in 55D.

[GM] 23:25:53
Uh… what's this thing? Um, you notice that this is, uh… airlock door, but for, like.

[Ink] 23:25:55
That's gonna be another one.

[GM] 23:26:02
has, like, a pressurization. That's like, this might… Um, there's no warnings or anything, so you don't think it goes immediately out into space, but you think it's, um… likely, you know, connected to.

[GM] 23:26:17
you know, access to space.

[Ink] 23:26:21
is gonna go out, like, D is in dog.

[GM] 23:26:25
Oh, D? Um, yes, also D. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:26:26
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, 55B has an interlock between… I see that, sorry, yeah, and then there's a… D as in dog, but I'm curious.

[GM] 23:26:32
Yeah. Yeah, my minimap, I also have that, which is funny, because the other side of it is also just a normal door, so I don't know which one it is.

[GM] 23:26:44
But I have both, um, so I don't know if this is a mistake or not, but… Um, yeah, it says that it's, uh… There's a, like, a depressurization door in between you and 55D.

[Ink] 23:26:59
Oh. It says, human… human emulation.

[GM] 23:27:05
Uh-huh.

[Ink] 23:27:07
Okay, so… Um, I'm the one… I got rid of my computer… my radio transmitter.

[Ink] 23:27:16
Um… Murderbot carries the human scanner. That means that Zeke, Carnoc, and Dex all have radio transmitters on their backs, right?

[GM] 23:27:27
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:27:28
Okay. I'm gonna motion for Dex. to come with me. I'm not gonna say anything.

[Ink] 23:27:34
Just kind of grab them and guide them over to 54B.

[GM] 23:27:37
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:27:39
And then kind of maybe not release your lights on or anything like that, but… Communicate to him non-verbally to set up his radio transmitter?

[GM] 23:27:49
Okay. Inside of 54B.

[Ink] 23:27:53
if it's inside 54B outside of the view of.

[Ink] 23:27:56
Potentially security cameras at 54A.

[GM] 23:27:58
Okay. So, who's going into 54B?

[Ink] 23:28:03
I'm taking Dex with me. Yeah. Dex and Ink, at least.

[GM] 23:28:08
Okay. you walk in, um, you see… that there are… 4 total 6 meter tall, uh… towers, that is, server racks.

[GM] 23:28:23
Um… they're wrapped in plastic, and they have decommissioned stamped all over them.

[GM] 23:28:31
Um… as you get out of sight of, um… The, uh, cameras and stuff, uh, you're… uh, light kind of catches… Um… a figure, the figure doesn't move at all, and…

[GM] 23:28:49
Uh, as you kind of… to sort of, like, lean a little bit and get a better view. Uh, there's definitely… The corpse that's giving off that.

[GM] 23:28:58
organic rot smell. Um, you see that it has… a number of puncture wounds to its chest.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:02
Oh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:10
Uh-oh.

[GM] 23:29:10
And its face is all disfigured. Does anyone have pathology?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:16
Ooh, maybe.

[GM] 23:29:17
Or surgery?

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:19
Ooh. I think.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:20
And not us, but…

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:26
or not.

[Ink] 23:29:26
I have pathology.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:27
Thank you. Well, is Zeke still in the outside room anyways, or… Oh, you do?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:27
Nope. It's not.

[Ink] 23:29:31
I have Pathology Inc has pathology. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:35
I have first aid.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:36
I have nothing.

[Ink] 23:29:37
So we're gonna roll… I roll a pathology here.

[GM] 23:29:39
You don't need to roll. You… you… can tell that the, um… Wounds on the chest, the puncture wounds are made from a small.

[Ink] 23:29:40
Oh, okay.

[GM] 23:29:50
Surgical implement, probably a scalpel.

[Ink] 23:30:07
Alright, well… That's not creepy.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:12
That's pretty creepy.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:13
I mean, can we tell how long it's been here?

[Ink] 23:30:13
Okay.

[GM] 23:30:17
Um… A while.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:21
Like, days… Alright.

[GM] 23:30:24
Yeah, probably, like, even weeks…

[Ink] 23:30:31
Okay, that's still just direct decks to set up his radio transmitter?

[GM] 23:30:36
Yeah, alright, it gets set up.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:38
Alright, ducks wrinkles up his nose, but gets to work.

[GM] 23:30:44
little antenna kind of comes out and, you know.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:46
What do we call this again? A surveillance thing, or…

[GM] 23:30:49
I think they're just, like, radio transmitters? Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:52
Radio transmitter?

[GM] 23:30:56
Let's see what Kilroy's not saying. Encrypted radio transmitter.

[Ink] 23:31:08
Alright, so we left at 54… B… we left the other one in the spider's layer, right?

[Ink] 23:31:17
Or was that at 60… 8… 60B.

[GM] 23:31:19
Uh, 60B…

[Ink] 23:31:38
Alright, I'm ready to get back in the other.

[GM] 23:31:40
Okay. Uh, you guys turn to leave. Uh, as you do, the door slams shut.

[GM] 23:31:47
Um… The door leading from 54B to 54A.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:47
Uh, which door?

[Dex Miro] 23:31:53
Oh, that wasn't closed before.

[GM] 23:31:54
Um… Well, you just went outside of sight of the room, so I assume the door was open. Regardless, the door is closed now.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:01
Oh. Okay.

[GM] 23:32:03
Um, and suddenly, sort of in, like, uh… flash of light, but that's, like, kind of distorted light.

[GM] 23:32:12
A man in a lab coat appears. a Halo of blades floats around his head.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:19
Can't blades.

[GM] 23:32:19
Um… he screams. you're still in 54B.

[Ink] 23:32:20
Okay, so we didn't… we… we didn't get to leave 54.

[Ink] 23:32:24
be worst of it. Okay.

[GM] 23:32:26
Um, he screams, when is suffering enough? Enough! All of them.

[GM] 23:32:33
Uh… And he reaches up and grabs… the, uh… The scalpels… out of the air, and uh… charges at you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:36
Huh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:44
Oh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:49
Oof.

[GM] 23:32:49
Um…

[Ink] 23:32:51
Oh, that's the last time Dex followed me into a dark room.

[GM] 23:32:57
Um… How old are you both?

[Ink] 23:33:02
We're… where's our age on this sheet?

[GM] 23:33:06
I mean, based on the… the pictures of everybody. Everyone's over the age of, like.

[GM] 23:33:13
28 to 30, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:33:15
Yeah, I mean, I would have guessed that says about 50, but.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:16
I'm probably, like, 2 years old. Oh, yeah, I was just born.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:21
were created.

[GM] 23:33:21
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:23
Yeah, I don't know how we judge Android age.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:27
Is it, like, dog ears?

[Ink] 23:33:29
Yeah, not like that.

[GM] 23:33:32
Okay. It's your guys' turn.

[Ink] 23:33:42
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:43
Wait, so… sorry, where did this guy appear, like, at the airlock from 54A to B?

[Ink] 23:33:48
He's apparently was hiding in the room.

[GM] 23:33:51
Um… he appeared…

[Dex Miro] 23:33:53
Like, he came out of B2A, and then the door shop behind him sort of deal.

[GM] 23:33:58
He, uh… No, what you saw is he appeared out of nowhere.

[GM] 23:34:03
in front of the door, and… the door sort of slammed shut behind him.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:03
Okay. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:09
Okay.

[GM] 23:34:12
And now he's charging it with scalpels in his hand.

[GM] 23:34:16
Hands.

[Ink] 23:34:20
It's… um, okay, so…

[Ink] 23:34:28
How much stress can you take before your head pops or something?

[GM] 23:34:33
Uh, as much stress as you want.

[Ink] 23:34:36
Oh, okay. Um…

[Ink] 23:34:42
Any indication that he's… a robot or not?

[GM] 23:34:48
Um… Not that you can necessarily tell.

[Ink] 23:34:55
But the things are floating around his head. Yeah, he takes 30, but yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:56
I can ask him to hold still while we scan him for 20 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:04
We're just gonna, like, run around in circles?

[Ink] 23:35:04
Oh .

[Ink] 23:35:08
Oh, man, we really could use a vibechete right now.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:12
I know, right? You're telling me.

[Ink] 23:35:15
Alright, um… I'm gonna take a… Yeah, shoot, so we wanna…

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:17
I have a pen knife.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:20
Wait, so where… where is everybody right now?

[GM] 23:35:23
Everybody else is in the other room. And 50, uh… 54A. No. They just kind of went in the room around the corner.

[Ink] 23:35:24
They're in this endorse, yeah. And… and…

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:26
Oh, I thought we were all together.

[GM] 23:35:33
Like, you could hear… well, you didn't actually hear anything because.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:33
Okay.

[GM] 23:35:38
Um, Inc. Was signaling everything to Dex, but, like, you could hear them, like.

[GM] 23:35:43
moving around, shuffling around, like, they were not far into the room before this happened.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:45
Was there a visible gasp? That I heard.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:46
So this new guy is closer to Murderbot and Carnoc or between us and the door?

[Ink] 23:35:50
But the doors closed behind it, so we're closed into 54B with him, right?

[GM] 23:35:56
He… she… he may be closer to them, but there's a door in between him and them, and he is definitely focused on you two.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:07
Okay, um, I think I'm misunderstanding where the door is versus everybody thought.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:07
Did we hear anything?

[Ink] 23:36:09
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:12
Oh, like, he shut the door between A and B.

[GM] 23:36:13
Um… Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:16
Okay, that's… that's what I'm getting.

[Ink] 23:36:21
and got between us and the door. So we got no escape.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:25
Yep.

[GM] 23:36:25
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:36:26
And our buddies are on the other side of the door.

[Ink] 23:36:30
Um, do you have any guns, Dex?

[Dex Miro] 23:36:33
Um, I think I have… Like, some random SMG after I threw away my pulse rifle and lost my vibechete.

[Ink] 23:36:45
Alright, because I'm tempted to assume he's a robot and try to.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:48
I mean, is this, uh, this… You said it's just a guy on a lab coat, like, he doesn't look like he's wearing armor or anything.

[Ink] 23:36:49
do an astronautics.

[GM] 23:36:56
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:57
Okay, and he's… he's not very far away from me, then.

[GM] 23:37:02
He is not far away from you.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:04
Alright, I guess, can I try shooting him with my SMG?

[GM] 23:37:07
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:10
He seems pretty crazy, right? Like, he's not gonna listen to me talking to him.

[GM] 23:37:14
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:15
Okay, yeah, I'll shoot that in. Combat?

[GM] 23:37:20
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:22
Normal or disadvantaged?

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:23
GM, do I have, like, super hearing? No?

[GM] 23:37:26
Do you have super hearing? I don't know, why would you have super hearing?

[Dex Miro] 23:37:30
I don't know, he's an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:30
I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:35
Just a normal roll or disadvantage?

[GM] 23:37:37
Uh, just normal roll.

[Ink] 23:37:42
Oh, nice. Oh, yeah.

[GM] 23:37:42
All right, um… He succeeds. Um… You take all your SMG.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:44
unless exceeded at something.

[GM] 23:37:51
You aim it directly at him. He's not… not super far away.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:51
Finally…

[GM] 23:37:55
This is an easy target. Um… The, uh, bullets pass right through him. His body kind of distorts.

[GM] 23:38:06
um… flickers… Uh… as if somehow, like, uh… Almost like how, like, ah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:12
liquor.

[GM] 23:38:15
like, old cathode ray tube sometimes would flicker if, like, a magnet passed over the surface of it.

[GM] 23:38:23
Um… And, uh, the bullets, uh, go penetrating through the door. Everybody on the other side of the door is like, what the Why are they shooting at the door?

[Ink] 23:38:35
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:35
Okay, so they don't go through the door, they just hit the door.

[GM] 23:38:38
No, no, they go through the door. They don't cause anyone on the other side of the door any injury.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:41
Oh.

[GM] 23:38:43
Um, but yeah, no… the bulls shoot right through the door.

[Ink] 23:38:45
Yeah. Okay, and none of the bullets hit the blades?

[GM] 23:38:53
Nope, every… all the bolts just passed right through him and the blades.

[Ink] 23:38:57
Oh, and so they pass through the blade, so do you believe that the blades would… are not physical?

[Ink] 23:39:01
As much as he's not physical.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:04
We'll… we'll find out when he stops us.

[GM] 23:39:05
Yeah, yeah, I mean, like, it doesn't seem like it right now, but he seems intent on still.

[Ink] 23:39:07
Good.

[GM] 23:39:11
stabbing you with his… with his plates.

[Ink] 23:39:14
I'm gonna do an Espernetic Feedback Loop. Which is a cyanic attack that overloads targeted electronics.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:19
Alright.

[Ink] 23:39:21
I make a sanity save. If successful, deal damage equals the rolled amount on failure to take one DMG.

[Ink] 23:39:26
And gain one stress. So, I'm gonna do a sanity save…

[GM] 23:39:28
Cool.

[GM] 23:39:38
Okay. Yeah. Smoke… smoke burns out your ears.

[Ink] 23:39:40
I get one stressed and, uh, one damage, and nothing happens, except for smoke coming out of my ears, as usual.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:53
I'll do an Espernetic. Right?

[GM] 23:39:53
Um… To, like, go over the door, and you, like, open up the door, and you're like, what are you guys doing in here? You see a guy in a coat, and you're like, Espernetic.

[Ink] 23:40:04
I like it, yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:04
Well, I can see through the bullet holes. There's a corpse in there.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:11
And I target that thing.

[GM] 23:40:12
Uh…

[Ink] 23:40:14
Does this guy resemble… resemble the corpse in any way?

[Dex Miro] 23:40:14
I wonder if…

[GM] 23:40:18
He does not resemble the corpse, but… That's fine.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:22
I wonder if Dex believes in ghosts.

[GM] 23:40:23
I don't think that you… like, the target's probably just, like.

[GM] 23:40:27
sort of electronics, is my guess. But yeah, go for it. Sanity safe.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:34
Entity saves?

[GM] 23:40:35
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:39
Normal. Modifier. Fuck me.

[GM] 23:40:40
Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh.

[Ink] 23:40:45
Yours is worse than mine, it's just 25. It's just…

[GM] 23:40:47
Just steam coming out of those ears.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:48
Dude, I… my two last roles have been just junk.

[GM] 23:40:56
Um, Zeke and… Karnak.

[Ink] 23:40:57
And Dex Roll's an amazing role.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:57
Do you… do… Yeah, do the other guys see that there's steam coming up, there's smoke coming out of my ears?

[GM] 23:41:06
Yeah, I'm gonna say that you had to open the door in order to get, like, actually a good line of sight for anything.

[Ink] 23:41:07
Somebody, somebody's…

[Ink] 23:41:11
Somebody toss the EMP grenade in.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:14
So he waited until I shot the door and then opened the door.

[GM] 23:41:18
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:20
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:22
I am completely good for nothing.

[Ink] 23:41:25
Right, can I… can I… can I… after I did my aspirin, I think, do I have enough movement to push.

[GM] 23:41:27
Uh…

[Ink] 23:41:30
like, decks out of the way.

[GM] 23:41:35
Um… sure? You effectively interposed yourself in that.

[GM] 23:41:41
Yeah, so you'll be attacked instead of him. Okay. That's fine.

[Ink] 23:41:43
Yeah.

[GM] 23:41:51
Uh, Zeke and Carnoc.

[Ink] 23:41:55
Yo, I got 10 toes to give, you know.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:41:57
I guess I should show that.

[GM] 23:42:01
I'm gonna shoot at him?

[Dex Miro] 23:42:03
That's… I guess… I mean, that's… That's probably a completely reasonable thing for you to do. I don't know how clearly you could see what Dex was doing.

[Ink] 23:42:04
No, that's not… let's not Susan, please shoot him.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:14
So…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:42:15
You can't see.

[Ink] 23:42:15
Excuse me.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:42:18
I don't know, do you not want me to shoot at him?

[Ink] 23:42:21
No, don't shoot him.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:23
I mean, it… it all depends on what you think.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:42:23
The complaints.

[Ink] 23:42:27
what Carnoc would do, I… yeah, I can understand that Carnoc would light him up.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:28
Yeah, what do you think, Carnoc saw?

[Ink] 23:42:32
I think I've used all my moves to yell, don't shoot him.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:42:39
Alright, I want you.

[Ink] 23:42:42
Because as we kind of do, that's what Carnage should do.

[Ink] 23:42:46
Oh.

[GM] 23:42:49
Noriko says, if you're not gonna shoot, I will.

[Ink] 23:42:52
Oh, no, it's an old her shoe.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:54
Does Noriko have a gun?

[GM] 23:42:55
Of course he picked up an SMG. Why wouldn't she?

[Ink] 23:42:59
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:59
Everybody's got one.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:00
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:43:00
She, like, um.

[Ink] 23:43:03
If you shoot them, they're not taking you to the Minotaur.

[GM] 23:43:07
Uh, she, like, uh… pulls back on the top, uh, and then, you know.

[GM] 23:43:13
just starts firing wildly, mostly shooting the ceiling.

[Dex Miro] 23:43:18
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:43:22
Huh.

[GM] 23:43:22
You, like, you, like, see, like, the recoil from the gun is just, like, causing her to just, like… Spray the top of the everywhere.

[GM] 23:43:32
Um… Yeah. Anyways, Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:43:37
Well, I'm hearing, don't shoot, don't shoot, although I do have an acid balloon that's burning a hole in my pocket.

[Dex Miro] 23:43:45
Clearly. It just… it just started now after a couple months.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:43:46
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:43:50
Right. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:43:53
I guess I'll… I guess I'll do nothing and just wait.

[GM] 23:43:58
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:00
Good, because Dex doesn't want to be hit by an acid balloon.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:02
Well, I've never successfully hit an enemy in this game so far, but it could be the first time.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:07
Wait, really?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:08
I'm pretty sure.

[GM] 23:44:12
Um… okay.

[GM] 23:44:30
Alright, uh, he runs up to Inc. He didn't shoot.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:34
Right, so what did Carnoc do? Nothing.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:44:37
Nothing, yeah.

[GM] 23:44:40
Just wants to see what's gonna happen here. Um… Alright, make a, uh… Sanity save Inc.

[GM] 23:44:59
Okay. He stabs you.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:05
Like, release tabs you, or…

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:06
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

[GM] 23:45:07
For… for 9.

[Ink] 23:45:10
that hurt.

[GM] 23:45:14
And he screams… When it's suffering enough? Enough! All of them!

[Dex Miro] 23:45:21
So it's only got one type of dialogue.

[Ink] 23:45:22
That is…

[GM] 23:45:27
Yeah, he's only got that one line of dialogue.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:28
We're gonna have to separate his head from his body.

[Ink] 23:45:34
So, as far as… Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:36
So he stabbed him with a scalpel?

[GM] 23:45:37
Yep.

[Ink] 23:45:38
But the bullets all went through the scalp.

[GM] 23:45:42
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:44
Well, we don't… I mean, I don't know the… I shot the scalpel, like they were floating above him, right? So if I was shooting at him, I wouldn't have hit him.

[GM] 23:45:51
Mm-hmm. Well, no, you're pretty sure, at least, you know, one bullet probably passed through a scalpel.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:00
Okay, so it wasn't just, like, above him, they were… it was kind of like a… Feel those scalpels, or…

[GM] 23:46:07
Yeah, I mean…

[Dex Miro] 23:46:10
That sounds terrifying enough.

[Ink] 23:46:10
All right, can I take a run towards the door and toss an EFP grenade behind me?

[GM] 23:46:15
Uh, sure. I don't… I think, uh… Um, Dex might still be in the room.

[Ink] 23:46:25
Hey, yelled, let's get out of your decks. Yeah, so really, let's get out of here. I'm gonna throw a heat grenade.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:25
Oh, alright. Well, I mean, are you gonna say anything while you're doing that, or are you just gonna…

[GM] 23:46:31
Gotcha. Um, you find that… wrestling yourself away from, uh, him is… Extremely easy, to the point where you feel like even.

[GM] 23:46:43
maybe some of your… body moves through his body?

[GM] 23:46:49
Um… the two run out of the room, um… and take cover around the edges, and then toss the EMP in there.

[GM] 23:47:00
Um, make a combat check.

[GM] 23:47:11
Okay. You guys are rolling like today. Love it. I love it.

[Ink] 23:47:15
Yeah.

[GM] 23:47:17
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:47:22
I have been a disproportionate amount of 90 plus rules.

[GM] 23:47:40
Uh, EMP goes… Blast goes off, um…

[GM] 23:47:49
Murderbot make a, uh… make a speed check with Advantage.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:51
That's right.

[GM] 23:48:06
Okay. Um… Alright, you're… you're able to get… a reasonable distance away from the blast.

[GM] 23:48:15
Um… Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:17
Ooh…

[GM] 23:48:23
Okay, um… After the… after the… Sort of, like… Of the, um, grenade. You peer back inside and the.

[GM] 23:48:33
Uh, the figure is turned in your direction, scalpels in hand, running towards you.

[Ink] 23:48:44
the grenade didn't do anything.

[GM] 23:48:48
Uh, it does not appear to have done anything.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:55
Oh my god.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:14
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:16
GM, it says I still have a purple crystal.

[GM] 23:49:20
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:21
Should I throw it at him?

[GM] 23:49:26
I can't answer that for you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:28
Wait, do I have the purple crystal still on me?

[Ink] 23:49:33
Buck in your chin.

[GM] 23:49:33
Yeah, it's probably still stuck in your chin.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:36
Yeah, can I try and, like… stick it on him and then try and merge with him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:41
Or, like, control of. Is that something we should try, guys?

[GM] 23:49:42
Sure.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:49:47
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:47
Oh, I like this. You don't have time to ask me, but I like this.

[Ink] 23:49:48
I got nothing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:52
Yeah. I throw it at him.

[GM] 23:49:54
Alright, uh.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:57
It might go through, and we'll find out.

[Ink] 23:50:00
Of course he's done.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:00
it just bounces off of them.

[GM] 23:50:02
Yeah, you're… it's not hard to throw, and yeah, it just passes right through him.

[GM] 23:50:07
clinks and bounces along the floor behind him.

[Ink] 23:50:09
And that's only worth, like, 30 billion credits, too.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:13
It didn't stick to it, so you can pick it up.

[GM] 23:50:15
Yeah, you can just go pick it up later.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:15
if we live.

[Ink] 23:50:17
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:21
God it. Alright, well…

[GM] 23:50:32
Uh, Zeke and Carnoc.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:33
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:50:38
Can I shoot now?

[Dex Miro] 23:50:43
I mean, you can, but it's not helpful. It's up to you whether Zika understands that it's not helpful.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:50:48
Zeke understands it's not helpful.

[Ink] 23:50:52
Yeah, it feels like there's gotta be something else, right? We can do.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:55
There's gotta be… yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:51:00
Mind bullets? I don't know, what do you got?

[Ink] 23:51:02
Has he… has he left that room yet, GM?

[Dex Miro] 23:51:03
Zeke's the smart one, right?

[GM] 23:51:05
No, he's still in there.

[Ink] 23:51:11
And yes, correct feedback was the only other thing, but… Me and Murderbot can't ever pull that thing off.

[Dex Miro] 23:51:18
I've got is trying to back it with the spanner, and I don't think that's gonna work.

[GM] 23:51:22
Um… Noriko… uh, empties the rest of her clip into the ceiling, um… And then, uh, when the bullets run out, uh… you hear, uh, children screaming from 55A.

[Murderbot V2] 23:51:41
What the.

[Ink] 23:51:43
children screening from 558.

[Ink] 23:51:48
And that's where we heard the rustling before.

[GM] 23:51:50
Mm-hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:52:11
I'm not gonna… I mean, I don't have anything to do.

[GM] 23:52:11
Zeke and Carnoc.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:52:14
Yeah, I'm not here to do. At what?

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:15
Carnoc, shoot away!

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:21
I don't know.

[GM] 23:52:27
Alright, um… Ink, make a sanity save.

[Ink] 23:52:30
We're gonna die.

[GM] 23:52:44
You get stabbed for another 5.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:52:47
Ooh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:47
Oh my god.

[Ink] 23:52:48
Okay, so that takes me 4 below… where do I mark my wounds?

[GM] 23:52:55
Um… I don't know how you mark them, um, but I will tell you what your wound is in a second.

[Dex Miro] 23:53:06
Tracking wounds with Resolve, right?

[Ink] 23:53:10
Oh, Resolve, okay, there you go. So I got one Resolve.

[Dex Miro] 23:53:14
Yeah, there's just nowhere else to put it.

[GM] 23:53:18
Uh, roll a D10.

[GM] 23:53:29
8. Um, he stabs you in the neck.

[GM] 23:53:36
You're… you're bleeding… profusely.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:37
Oh, no.

[GM] 23:53:42
You're gonna bleed out… basically, you take 6 damage automatically next round.

[GM] 23:53:48
Unless you treat the, uh… The bleeding wound.

[Ink] 23:53:53
I have the stimpack, is it our turn yet?

[GM] 23:53:56
Uh, yeah, it's your guys' turn.

[Ink] 23:54:00
So he keeps coming after me, so…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:54:05
Can I run in and grab him and…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:54:06
Pull them out of there.

[GM] 23:54:07
Alright, you run up to… Wait, who are you grabbing?

[Ink] 23:54:11
I'm in… I ran out into 54A and threw the grenade in.

[Ink] 23:54:16
And then he came out of 54A and stabbed me again.

[Ink] 23:54:19
Our feed came out of Facebook and set me again, right?

[GM] 23:54:25
Yeah, he's in 54A with everybody else.

[Ink] 23:54:29
So there's nowhere to grab me and pull me out of.

[Ink] 23:54:32
We can run into the room with screaming children.

[Dex Miro] 23:54:37
Does DEX see anything in this room that could be… generating this apparition, or something like that.

[GM] 23:54:45
Uh, you don't… there's no, like, like, projector type of, like.

[GM] 23:54:51
You know, uh, any other… anything that's, like, projecting him, no.

[Dex Miro] 23:54:56
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:02
And there's… none of us have any experience with generating some… Something like this that doesn't exist, but can somehow stab people.

[GM] 23:55:13
Um… Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:55:22
I have a hollow projector. What do I do with that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:55:26
That sounds, uh, plausible.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:29
I mean, my… I was gonna… wait, do I have a helipad?

[GM] 23:55:51
I imagine that hardly any of you have any experience with something like this.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:59
Does my holo pet have to have a cute, friendly appearance, or can it be something.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:04
Terrifying, like, a saber-toothed tiger, and I can project it and see if this guy reacts to it.

[GM] 23:56:12
Uh, it could be… Terrifying, I think? I don't know.

[Ink] 23:56:14
Make…

[GM] 23:56:17
Let's see why not.

[Ink] 23:56:17
You make it look like me? Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:23
Alright, well, like, I mean, nothing else I'm doing is working, so can I wait till I even have a hollow projector?

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:24
Okay, hold… Hold on, let me…

[Dex Miro] 23:56:30
Yes, I do. So, can I try projecting? Sorry, what are you saying?

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:33
Can I…

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:39
Are we… okay, so you guys went into that room.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:42
shot out from that door. Right? But then you guys came out of that room, or no?

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:49
We went into the room.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:49
My… well… I guess we did kind of dive out of there, and then the MP grenade happened, so I guess… The implication is we're all in the same room now, does that sound right, GM?

[GM] 23:57:01
Yeah, you're all in the same… you're all on 54A right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:03
It's just on the same room. Listen, I… worst comes to worst.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:10
I'll just run and grab him and keep running to the other side, and Carnoc can use the… use… use the kill switch.

[Ink] 23:57:19
We can't touch him. We can't… we can't physically interact with him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:21
we can't do anything.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:21
I mean, you… you think you can, but I very much doubt you can grab him, but if you… If you think that's a word about today, you should try that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:21
No, no, I'm

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:30
Wait, what is this thing? What the. What do you mean I can't grab them?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:33
Me wrong, I would

[Ink] 23:57:35
He's a figment of my imagination that makes me bleed out of the neck.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:39
Somehow a figment of everyone's imagination.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:41
So, there's a room with, like, kids in it, or something?

[GM] 23:57:45
Uh, you hear children screaming in 55A.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:45
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:57:46
We heard kids screaming.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:49
Can we go in there and see what's going on in there?

[Dex Miro] 23:57:52
Yeah, but we should definitely let the terrifying thing end the row of children screaming.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:54
time.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:57:56
Well, but maybe they know what the hell's going on.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:00
Maybe somehow he's their nightmare, I don't know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:02
I'm gonna go in.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:58:03
Or maybe it's something else and not children.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:06
Maybe they're what?

[Ink] 23:58:07
I got nothing better, let's. let's run into 55A.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:58:07
Maybe it's something that's, you know.

[GM] 23:58:12
Alright. Ink with blood shooting out of his neck.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:15
Oh my god.

[GM] 23:58:17
Runs over to the door at 55A and opens it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:20
Zeke's going too, and I'm…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:23
Furiously trying to apply my first aid kit to

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:26
Ink's neck while I do so. Stand still!

[GM] 23:58:27
Okay. Uh… You open the door, um, and two children, um… Uh, boy, probably the age of around 6?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:43
Oh, dear.

[GM] 23:58:44
With blonde hair, uh, comes running out, as well as, um.

[GM] 23:58:48
little girl, probably around the… around age 8 or so, brown hair comes running out.

[GM] 23:58:55
And they're kind of screaming to kind of see you guys, um… And, like, are kind of terrified, um, and they run over to the, uh.

[GM] 23:59:06
door to 55D, which is the decompression door. And they kind of start pounding on it, um.

[GM] 23:59:13
I need someone to roll a D100.

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:17
Not doing it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:59:19
All right, since I am here.

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:26
This is just a trial.

[GM] 23:59:32
Okay. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:59:43
I think your role is better than my potentially critical fail pap.

[GM] 23:59:45
Alright, uh, upon seeing the children, uh, the man falls to his knees and goes.

[GM] 23:59:52
Starts crying. Never. Never enough. Never, never enough. And then, uh, he winks out.

[GM] 00:00:00
He's gone.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:02
What the. Alright.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:00:02
Yeah, see? Look at that brilliant idea.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:06
I immediately… and register my first aid kit, or whatever is in there to.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:14
Should I stop the bleeding?

[GM] 00:00:20
Um, Ink, make a sanity save with Advantage.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:25
Oh, it's not even real.

[GM] 00:00:32
Yeah. Um… yeah, the… The bleeding stops, um…

[Ink] 00:00:32
Double. What the heck? Save one of those.

[Ink] 00:00:37
My neck just grew back.

[GM] 00:00:47
Uh, in fact… The… the wound isn't even really there?

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:54
Oh my god…

[GM] 00:00:55
Um, however, that being said, uh… the flesh is necrotized.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:59
Ghost. Oh, no…

[Ink] 00:01:04
So I still have the wound.

[GM] 00:01:06
You still have the wound, but you're not, like… There's no obvious, like, laceration for your blood to come out.

[Ink] 00:01:15
So there wasn't the… it wasn't the result of the first day.

[GM] 00:01:21
Um, I mean… Murder bots, cold clammy hands applying his first aid kit to your neck seemed to… seemed real nice.

[Ink] 00:01:23
We don't know.

[Ink] 00:01:29
Okay. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:36
I can't just turn that into decorating. The crosses, no.

[GM] 00:01:36
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:44
What is happening? I'm so confused.

[GM] 00:01:47
uh… the children's are, like, pounding on the door, and they're like.

[GM] 00:01:50
We want to go back to please let us back to please, please, we want to go back to.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:01:56
Oh, or help?

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:57
The. Oh my god.

[GM] 00:01:58
To.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:01:59
Oh. Is that usually a good place, children.

[GM] 00:02:04
Um… And I… I was gonna say, I think this is where we stop.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:02:05
Alright, I gotta go to bed, everybody, so…

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:05
What is happening?

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:11
I don't want to snap here, this is not good!

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:21
Um, guys… What do you guys' schedules?

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:25
For next session.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:02:33
You… Monday, or Tuesday next week.

[Dex Miro] 00:02:40
Yeah, same.

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:42
I could do Tuesday. Yep.

[Dex Miro] 00:02:45
You said Tuesday's good. Zeke?

[Dex Miro] 00:02:50
Oh, Zeke is wandering.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:02:53
If I were

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:02:55
Sorry.

[Dex Miro] 00:02:56
Didn't they say anything yet?

[Ink] 00:02:57
I'm good, whatever, today, I forgot what's my, uh… But here, I forgot, I didn't… I forgot when we scheduled that this was my wife's birthday, so I can't do any worse than that.

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:59
I could.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:08
Oh, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:09
Oh, no. They… oh no.

[GM] 00:03:12
How mad at you is she?

[Ink] 00:03:14
Hi, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:19
Zeke, you're good with next Tuesday.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:19
Hey, oh no.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:21
My Little Tuesday.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:24
Um… yes, I believe so.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:27
Okay.

[GM] 00:03:29
Let me just double check, but I'm pretty sure I'm good, too.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:33
Nay, how can we help?

[GM] 00:03:33
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:03:36
Very good, we're good.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:38
Oh, no.

[GM] 00:03:39
He's on baby duty, that's the least he could do.

[Ink] 00:03:42
That's, yeah.

[Ink] 00:03:50
ChatGPT will not make me children then. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:53
How do you get it to be cons…

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:54
Yeah, I…

[Dex Miro] 00:03:54
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:56
consistent with the, uh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:58
the characters. I still can't get it to do that when I try to do things.

[Ink] 00:04:01
So I had, um, I think you guys all had given me images originally of what your character should look like. I might have… I might have, uh… they might have been cartoonish or something like that, but I have base images.

[Ink] 00:04:12
And so then every time I want, like. you know, like, Zeke to be in something. I have an image, the base image of Zeke.

[Ink] 00:04:19
And so then I say, this is Zeke. And I want him to be in the room.

[Ink] 00:04:24
with Murderbot and, like, Murderbot watching him sleep, or chronic sleep, or something like that.

[Ink] 00:04:28
So I'll combine, like, 3.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:04:28
Okay, so you're like…

[Dex Miro] 00:04:30
So you… do you have to re-feed it those images every time you ask it for something?

[Ink] 00:04:34
Right, yeah, I don't try to keep the same session. I like a clean session, and then I feed the base images in.

[Dex Miro] 00:04:37
Oh, interesting.

[Ink] 00:04:40
And tell it, like, you know, this is… you know, the guy with glasses is Zeke.

[Ink] 00:04:44
the guy that… with the overalls is Murderbot. I usually call him MB, because it doesn't like when I say murderbot, and it's like, okay, you know, Zeke and Murderbot are… are, uh, shaking hands, right, and it'll draw me.

[Ink] 00:04:55
It does pretty well. Now, when I put, like, 5 people in there, that's when you'll see sometimes it messes up when I have to do it a couple times, where, like.

[Dex Miro] 00:05:01
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:05:02
makes the same person twice, or, like, I had when I told it, like, murder bot to throw it at the crazy guy, you can see that crazy guy kind of looks more like Murderbot than he did.

[Ink] 00:05:09
in the first images and stuff, so… It starts to get a little bit confused.

[Ink] 00:05:13
But generally, yeah, starting from a brand new context is your best bet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:05:13
Oh, that's interesting.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:05:18
Okay.

[Ink] 00:05:19
and then putting in the image you want. Now, um, Gemini is way better at it with Nano Banana.

[Ink] 00:05:26
But it doesn't always… give me results, if that makes sense. Like, ChatGPT's pretty consistent.

[Ink] 00:05:32
But Nano Banana will be, like, really, really well, like, replicating the things. Like, it… It does it almost perfect, like you would know it changed.

[Ink] 00:05:42
And the people will be more realistic looking. But Gemini seems to have more guardrails as well.

[Ink] 00:05:49
like, I was able to get. I had… it started to make him stabbing me in the neck.

[Ink] 00:05:54
And then it rejected that one, and then I just had to tell it, like, right before the 7, and then…

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:06:00
Okay, yeah, I'll have to try that. I always try, like, I make an image, and I'm like, okay,

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:06:04
you know, take the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:06:06
you know, girl or boy in this image, and, like, generate a new image with that same person, and it can't do it.

[Ink] 00:06:12
Yeah, it doesn't seem to keep the context very well.

[Ink] 00:06:15
But I would, yeah, I would save the image, and then I would start a brand new chat, and it would be your best bet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:06:19
Okay, I'll try that.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:21
Yeah, it's sort of counterintuitive, but I guess that kind of makes sense.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:25
Um, real quick, GM, click which door were the children pounding on at the end, the one they came out of?

[GM] 00:06:30
The… no, the 1 to 55D.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:33
I lost track of what's what. Oh, the… okay, so the airlock one still.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:06:38
The human omelet notice. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:41
I mean, they're going to.

[GM] 00:06:45
They wanna… they wanna go back to.

[GM] 00:06:50
Um… oh, that's… okay. As you should.

[Murderbot V2] 00:06:52
I'm gonna have nightmares now.

[Murderbot V2] 00:06:59
She's not good.

[GM] 00:07:07
Um, do you guys remember what room you found the purple crystals in?

[Murderbot V2] 00:07:07
Ah.

[GM] 00:07:11
It was pretty early on, it was… Right.

[Ink] 00:07:14
Yeah, it was in the 60s. Q1 or something like that.

[Murderbot V2] 00:07:14
It was really… it was when the, um… With the, with the, uh… the, um… The Android game.

[Ink] 00:07:21
There's, like, 61C or 61B.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:23
Yeah, that was like 2 sessions ago or no, that was.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:28
Yeah, it's just the previous one.

[GM] 00:07:35
61C. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:37
Yeah. Here's… that's when it happened.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:07:52
Alright, now guys!

[GM] 00:07:54
Hi, Zeke.

[Ink] 00:07:54
And Zeke, thanks for saving us.

[Murderbot V2] 00:07:55
Alright, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:56
Thank you.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:07:56
Yeah.
