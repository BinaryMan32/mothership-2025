[GM] 21:14:31
Not divers, because these are the ones specifically that, um, wearing gear and look like, um, manager Rachel Kilroy's team.

[GM] 21:14:38
They're the troubleshooters, that's it. So… Here's a major way to… Um… or once you encountered them, they… Uh… Our intrepid android had identified himself as being an android, which caused them to open fire upon you guys.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:14:42
He destroys it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:14:52
This guy's not building his foot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:14:53
Don't give him a

[GM] 21:15:00
Um, you quickly surrendered, uh, both yourselves and your weapons.

[GM] 21:15:03
Although, um… Zeke was, uh, injured and played dead. His body just sort of tumbling about in the zero-g space.

[GM] 21:15:15
Um… and then after having… Um, effectively been captured. There were… Taking you along and, uh, you notice these, like.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:15:19
Maybe I'll go at it.

[GM] 21:15:27
metal strands throughout the rooms that you've been moving through.

[GM] 21:15:32
And, uh… lo and behold, at a specific intersection, the doors opened up, revealing this.

[GM] 21:15:39
giant, creepy, spider-type creature. Um… That, uh, looked like it was going to… Attack.

[GM] 21:15:49
And that's what it does. Okay.

[GM] 21:15:57
So we're in… Bearings.

[GM] 21:16:06
We're in… you guys went to the algae farm.

[GM] 21:16:12
That you're in 59B, the four-way intersection.

[GM] 21:16:19
Can I be… You guys are all on the big map, is that correct?

[Ink] 21:16:22
Mm-hmm. Okay. There's this moment.

[GM] 21:16:23
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:16:23
Yeah.

[GM] 21:16:28
Okay. So you're all… loosely, um… tied to each other. I mean, it's like.

[GM] 21:16:35
you can't easily just break your bonds. Um… But, uh, you're also, like… It's easy to move you because they can just kind of pull you through the zero G.

[GM] 21:16:48
part of this. Um, in this. four-way intersection, um… One of the things you guys were… Um… had encountered were, uh… This.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:16:55
Second. If you shoot through it.

[GM] 21:17:02
graffiti on the floor that said, you can't take it with you.

[GM] 21:17:06
Um… And there are blood stains… on the walls through… throughout these hallways.

[GM] 21:17:15
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:17
Is that picture spot on? Because that is pretty…

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:21
Creepy.

[GM] 21:17:24
Although, uh… Are they in the chat? Where are you looking at pictures?

[Dex Miro] 21:17:25
Or what?

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:29
In the… in the GitHub, the, um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:31
the journal. Did you see it?

[GM] 21:17:31
Oh. of the spider creature, I don't know which one you'd…

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:35
the… the hallway.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:17:42
This guy has such good animation.

[GM] 21:17:42
I don't know. I'm not… I don't… I don't have it open.

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:47
Oh,

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:17:48
You get loaded and coded.

[GM] 21:17:50
Probably pretty close.

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:52
Hold on, let me…

[Murderbot V2] 21:17:57
Is there a way to send this to him.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:00
Oh, there it goes.

[GM] 21:18:01
You put it in the chat, I'm looking at it now.

[GM] 21:18:05
Oh, is it? It's maybe a few more spikes than, uh… then maybe I would imagine, but that's not too far off.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:09
Whoa!

[Dex Miro] 21:18:14
That is a lot of spokes.

[GM] 21:18:16
Um, so you guys… so, in response to that, uh… they… I think they had asked you if you had any, uh, relics on you, or artifacts.

[GM] 21:18:25
And, um… And… Murderbot, what's your character's name again? Sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:28
Oh, no.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:32
Murderbot!

[GM] 21:18:33
Murderbot, right, Murderbot pulled out the purple gems, and they threw them, uh… Yeah, and they… they seem to fuse with, uh, Android flush.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:38
I was like, is this?

[GM] 21:18:46
Um, including his own. And for a moment, you were all connected in one consciousness.

[Murderbot V2] 21:18:48
Yep. Got a big…

[GM] 21:18:53
Um, and in trying to take control of them.

[GM] 21:18:57
you shut down, but they did not. Or one of them shut down, there's four of them.

[GM] 21:19:01
Right? So, um…

[GM] 21:19:09
got one on his chin. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:19:11
Like a pimple.

[GM] 21:19:16
Um…

[GM] 21:19:20
Oh, yeah, you can just read through this whole thing. I'm doing this blind, and it's all just right here.

[Murderbot V2] 21:19:24
Yeah, dude, he's right here!

[GM] 21:19:25
That's all right here. Good job. Dex and Ink, for putting this together.

[GM] 21:19:31
Um, okay. So yeah, so the door opens… That spider creature, um… Is a little more spider-esque than, um.

[GM] 21:19:42
what they were trying to go for. It's… supposed to have a few more human parts to it, but certainly the head part of it is, uh… Definitely looks like spider.

[GM] 21:19:56
So… All right, um… Um, I'm just gonna have… Uh, you guys go… First, uh, the troubleshooters seem intent on just shooting the out of that thing.

[Dex Miro] 21:20:16
Because why not?

[GM] 21:20:17
Actually, why don't I… I'm gonna have them go first, actually.

[GM] 21:20:21
So, they shoot. Got… What are these guys? These guys are…

[Ink] 21:20:26
We get an indication that they've seen this thing before, I mean…

[GM] 21:20:30
No, they… you hear in their sort of semi-robotic voices go, what the.

[GM] 21:20:35
And then they just… They just sort of start shooting at it.

[Ink] 21:20:36
Oh, that's interesting.

[GM] 21:20:41
Well, so you… you noted from having been on Commander Kilroy's.

[Dex Miro] 21:20:41
We are now this on, like, robots?

[GM] 21:20:46
uh, ship that, like, the visor helmet things that they wear.

[GM] 21:20:51
like, distort their voices, and they make them kind of sound robotic?

[Dex Miro] 21:20:51
Yeah. Oh, okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:20:55
I see. So it's not because they're address, it's just their… Armor.

[GM] 21:20:58
Yeah, just the… armor and stuff that they're wearing. Okay, they've got a…

[GM] 21:21:09
Okay, that's pretty… that's actually pretty… quite high.

[GM] 21:21:16
3D100… Okay. Two of them start shooting… I hit one of these guys wielding SMGs, I think.

[GM] 21:21:40
Um… Yeah, to start firing, uh, bullets are ricocheting off around, uh, the creature.

[GM] 21:21:49
Some of them strike true. When they do, you see the, um… penetrate and, uh, sort of white, milky material comes out of the creature.

[GM] 21:21:59
Um…

[GM] 21:22:04
Yeah. Alright, now I'll let you guys… they seem… Not… not concerned with you guys at all.

[Dex Miro] 21:22:14
So we're all still tied together, and we don't have weapons, right?

[GM] 21:22:18
Yes. Though your weapons are not far away, they kind of, like, strung them along as well, but they're… Like, there was… there was one… of them on either side of the line.

[GM] 21:22:30
Um… And then… the two of them were further ahead, uh, not very far away, and that they were one of… at least one of them was carrying the weapons.

[GM] 21:22:42
Um, let me figure out which one is shut down.

[GM] 21:22:49
Alright, the one in the back is the one that should.

[GM] 21:22:52
Shut down. The closest to you guys, I should say.

[Ink] 21:22:53
Oh, nice. He was the one guard in the weapons, essentially.

[GM] 21:22:58
No, no, no, he would have been… the other ones that are further away had the weapons.

[Ink] 21:23:03
Oh, we're in the front.

[GM] 21:23:07
No, there's… essentially two were near you guys and two were near your weapons.

[Ink] 21:23:11
Okay. So one on each side of us, the two that are near us.

[Ink] 21:23:19
And the one behind… and the one behind us.

[GM] 21:23:19
Yes, yes.

[Ink] 21:23:21
is now gone, and this… this… in the… the spider is in front of the guy that's in front of us.

[GM] 21:23:27
Yeah, the spider's closer to the ones that have your weapons than to you guys.

[Ink] 21:23:31
Okay, and the ones that had the weapons are out in front of us, as well.

[GM] 21:23:33
Yes, yeah.

[Ink] 21:23:35
in between us. So, all three of them are, except for the guy that's knocked out, are in between the spider and… Okay. And all 3 of them just fired at the spider. And we feel like they're doing damage to the spider?

[GM] 21:23:42
And you guys. Yeah.

[GM] 21:23:48
Yeah, you see, like, penetrations in the spider skin, like, this milky stuff substance kind of floating in the 0G.

[Ink] 21:23:54
Okay. Um, this is…

[GM] 21:23:55
Yeah. You're knocked out.

[Murderbot V2] 21:23:57
Am I left out?

[Murderbot V2] 21:24:00
Damn it.

[Ink] 21:24:01
The spider came through a door. So we get the, uh… We get the impression that it can open doors, so, like, going and hiding behind a door is not going to help us.

[GM] 21:24:04
Uh, yeah.

[GM] 21:24:13
Right.

[Ink] 21:24:14
Okay. They took our grenades and stuff, too.

[Murderbot V2] 21:24:20
They took everything.

[GM] 21:24:22
Uh, yeah, I mean… Unless you had one sort of hidden for some reason.

[GM] 21:24:28
in a place, but yeah.

[Ink] 21:24:30
How big is a grenade now?

[Ink] 21:24:36
Um…

[GM] 21:24:37
pineapple size, you're going for it?

[Ink] 21:24:41
And it's been that long in prison, yeah. No. Okay, so we essentially had… so the guy that's in front of us, he's moved.

[Ink] 21:24:50
board, you said we could potentially move forward and try to get our weapons, but that would put us… Not quite in the line of fire, but closer to the fighter.

[GM] 21:24:56
Very close to, yeah.

[Ink] 21:24:58
Okay. Now, do we have enough time in this move to grab our weapons and fire?

[GM] 21:25:07
Uh, no. Your best case scenario, if you can… You can move, get close to weapons, maybe… untangle them and redistribute them is… The sort of best case.

[Ink] 21:25:18
What we could do. Okay, and the spider has not moved yet.

[GM] 21:25:22
No. No.

[Ink] 21:25:23
Meeting yet.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:27
Can we just pull the weapons towards us so we don't get in the line of fire.

[GM] 21:25:31
Um, once you have them. I mean, they're… they're not on the same line as you guys are.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:35
Oh, they're not on the line, okay.

[GM] 21:25:36
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:25:40
Okay, how about… I'll go for the weapons. and you guys back off, because if I can send them to you, then you're not all in the line of fire. I have… Zero G training.

[Ink] 21:25:50
So I have a better chance of getting there, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:25:54
You gotta, like, use the line to do some sort of cool thing where you jump off the wall and then grab it, and then go back to the wall or something.

[Ink] 21:25:59
Well, shoot, but we're attached to each other. I can't move separately all.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:01
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:26:03
Except for my knife and my boot.

[GM] 21:26:07
If you have a knife in your boot, you can use it.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:14
Alright, yeah, I mean, you can try to…

[Ink] 21:26:16
Uh, does any… do any of us really have a knife? Is that a… I think.

[Ink] 21:26:22
Because that means one of us could move us all towards the weapons while somebody else tries to get us loose, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:26:30
True.

[Ink] 21:26:31
All attached together.

[GM] 21:26:32
I found a description for this thing. An emaciated android torso with 6 articulated scything blades for limbs.

[Ink] 21:26:39
Okay.

[GM] 21:26:40
top half of its head is all eyes. Lower jaw is replaced by surgical syringes slash probiot.

[GM] 21:26:47
Robiscuse? I don't know. Um, a huge nodule on its back spins forth a steel web.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:57
That sounds even more terrifying.

[Ink] 21:27:00
Yeah, um, what it is… so, other than the web.

[Ink] 21:27:03
It was arms or claws, or what did it have for, uh… weaponry doesn't have, like, a gun on it, right?

[GM] 21:27:09
As, like, side-like arms. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:27:11
sidelight art, okay. So it could flash or something, and they're metal, partially metal, or…

[GM] 21:27:15
Mm-hmm. Yep.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:27:17
Are you dead, guys?

[Ink] 21:27:19
Yeah, like, yeah. So it's… it does look partially mechanical, right?

[Murderbot V2] 21:27:21
That's what I'm doing.

[GM] 21:27:26
Yes.

[Ink] 21:27:27
So EMP grenades, if I got to an EMP grenade, could I get one of those off in this move, or it's just a matter of grabbing it, and then… Wait till next time.

[GM] 21:27:35
Yeah, it's a matter of just basically grabbing it.

[GM] 21:27:38
I mean, grapevine would also be a part of, like, freeing your bondage, too.

[Ink] 21:27:38
Okay.

[Ink] 21:27:43
Oh, we would be able to potentially get loose and go and grab the weapon.

[GM] 21:27:43
Like… Right, right.

[Ink] 21:27:48
Oh my gosh. Okay, so can I get loose and grab the weapon while… and push the weapons back while everybody else stays behind?

[Ink] 21:27:58
There's that, too.

[GM] 21:27:59
Um, you could get loose, grab the weapons, push them back.

[GM] 21:28:02
Uh, you wouldn't yourself have a weapon, because they would still sort of be bound to each other.

[Ink] 21:28:07
They're bound to each other, okay. I'll do that.

[GM] 21:28:11
Okay.

[Ink] 21:28:12
And then I suggest somebody tries to get Murder bought up.

[GM] 21:28:16
Alright, you get the knife out of your boot.

[GM] 21:28:18
Which just happened to be in there. You cut your bonds and… push yourself forward using your Zero Drink training.

[GM] 21:28:26
Um… You feel, uh… Like… You've spent a lot of time in ZeroG, and insofar as the… This maneuvering would be difficult for anybody who hasn't, um… So you get forward the, uh, sounds of the SMGs firing their bullets, like…

[GM] 21:28:46
near deafening, uh, in the… obviously the, uh, um… whatchamacallit.

[GM] 21:28:54
troubleshooters don't seem to see you as the same level of threat as this other thing, so they kind of.

[GM] 21:29:01
there's a shared understanding that maybe they won't… won't kill you, and maybe they could use your help, so they let you kind of do that.

[GM] 21:29:08
Um, so you throw the package of weapons back towards the rest of the group.

[GM] 21:29:27
And the weapons bounce off the rest of the team as they look dumbfounded.

[GM] 21:29:32
Bye.

[Ink] 21:29:39
Well, uh, how about… how about, uh, um… a Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:29:45
I'm not even close to you, am I?

[Ink] 21:29:48
you steer a little further back, right?

[GM] 21:29:50
Yeah, well, Zeke from… he was sort of hiding behind, uh… Back in the, uh, algae room, um… Zeke probably is, like, an… had enough to, like, be able to look up peer around the corner and see what's happening.

[Ink] 21:29:57
Oh, so he's way packing.

[GM] 21:30:06
Uh, maybe hasn't seen the spider creature yet, but he does see the, um… the rest of the troubleshooters unloading on something.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:30:15
Oh, okay, I thought it was… thought it was farther away.

[GM] 21:30:15
in the call corridor. You wanted to follow them, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:30:20
Yeah, I mean, I guess that would be ideal, sure, yeah.

[GM] 21:30:22
Yeah. Yeah. I guess, okay, I mean, if we're… if we're not sure, go ahead and make a speed check.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:30:30
Okay.

[GM] 21:30:34
Yeah, with Advantage. Because it's not like you're… they're racing really far ahead, but… Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:30:36
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:30:40
Right.

[GM] 21:30:50
Okay, yeah, you keep up with them pretty easily.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:31:20
It would make an amazing pet?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:31:22
John and Nigel.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:31:25
I mean, I guess I'll…

[Dex Miro] 21:31:27
Okay, so do I, like, roll to see if I can grab one of the guns, or… Interesting, okay.

[GM] 21:31:32
the package is right there. It's just gonna take someone's… someone's turn is gonna be, like, basically un… coupling them and redistribute them, and then whoever doesn't do that can.

[GM] 21:31:42
Actually, you know, shoot. They want.

[Murderbot V2] 21:31:43
What's their role?

[Dex Miro] 21:31:44
Right. Well, let me… I'll do that, because I have zero-G training also, and then Carnoc's much better at firing weapons than everybody else, so…

[GM] 21:31:51
Okay. Alright, more or less everyone has their weapons, except for maybe Zeke, unless, Zeke, you decide to, like, reveal yourself and go up and join the rest of the team.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:04
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:06
Well, at least we'll…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:08
try to scope out what's going on. I mean, it sounds like…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:14
Yeah, I mean, that sounds like it might be a good idea to try to grab my weapon, given that…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:19
the captors are letting the rest of the party

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:21
sort of do that, so…

[GM] 21:32:23
Okay. Without revealing yourself to the troubleshooters, uh, you get into a better position and kind of signal to, um.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:25
Yeah.

[GM] 21:32:33
Frederick, your character's name is Dex, is that right? Dex. He's like, no, the Dex, and Dex, uh, kind of throws your weapon down the hallway.

[Dex Miro] 21:32:35
Next, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:32:40
Okay.

[GM] 21:32:41
Um, towards you. Um… So you… you're now maybe in a position where you can kind of see the spider creature.

[GM] 21:32:48
Um, and your position such that you can catch your weapon, which will arrive shortly.

[GM] 21:32:54
Um… Murder weapons, uh, weapon just kind of bounces off of his, you know, shut down body.

[GM] 21:33:02
Uh, and then, um… Carnex receives… I don't know what gun you were holding, or what you were carrying with you.

[GM] 21:33:09
Uh, but you have that weapon now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:16
I know what weapon I was carrying with me.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:20
I'm assuming.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:33:20
Probably my… probably my SMG. I don't know.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:33:26
is the Will remark. No, I don't have it on my sheet.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:26
Do you have a pulse rifle, too? No.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:31
Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:33:32
that the Wilbur Merck 2 is, like, the long distance, you know.

[GM] 21:33:39
Yeah, and also, it's uh… that has the anti-armor, right?

[GM] 21:33:44
capacity, um, which… could potentially puncture the hull of a… of a ship, if it's near the edge of space.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:53
Oh yeah, don't do that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:58
Each character has their own…

[Ink] 21:33:59
We got vac sheets on, why are we?

[GM] 21:34:01
Uh, I believe many of the suits were damaged in the previous firefight.

[Ink] 21:34:05
Oh.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:05
This is true.

[GM] 21:34:07
Yeah. They wouldn't necessarily hold against a vacuum anymore.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:09
watching the trend

[Dex Miro] 21:34:13
Alright, do your… do your thing.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:16
Oh, cool. Basically, any robot made of soft material, a lot of them mimic how terrible

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:34:23
Uh… guess I'll click shot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:26
So I need air to expand.

[GM] 21:34:27
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:29
latex to move that way.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:34:31
How do I roll that again? I think was on firearms, like, or doesn't…

[GM] 21:34:34
Uh… combat… combat is the one they should. And then, yeah, if you have firearm training, you can use that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:44
Let's cover it with our new Phantom.

[GM] 21:34:51
Okay, you hit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:55
I'm trying to get too much to hit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:57
We got the juice itself up, get more power.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:57
Sweet.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:34:59
I guess… It's 2D10 for my SMG.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:35:00
She had basically been the big tank man.

[GM] 21:35:04
Yeah. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:35:04
traction.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:35:08
That's the view.

[GM] 21:35:08
Great. Um… You shoot it, uh… it takes a wound.

[GM] 21:35:18
Let's see… Where's my wounds table?

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:23
Are you shooting the spider?

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:27
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:27
Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:35:28
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:30
I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:32
Okay.

[GM] 21:35:35
Okay… To, um, gunfire.

[GM] 21:35:41
You shoot it in its rib. Breaks a rib.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:45
It's a rib.

[GM] 21:35:48
All right.

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:49
You know, it's flinging about making noises.

[GM] 21:35:54
Um… Right, that's pretty much everyone's turn, right?

[Ink] 21:35:59
What did Dex do? I miss what Dex did.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:02
I grab the ball of weapons and made sure Carnoc was able to fire, because I'm bad at shooting, and he's good at shooting.

[Ink] 21:36:07
Nice. Okay, so nobody was able to reboot Mother, uh, Murbot.

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:13
Nobody…

[Dex Miro] 21:36:13
No, I don't know how to do that quickly anyway, so I figured it was better to not die first.

[Ink] 21:36:19
It's… it's very close to the same word that makes them explode, I think that Carnoc has to say.

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:25
I would laugh so hard if you just, like, tried to just floated me towards the spider, and just…

[GM] 21:36:30
I'm just pushed on toward that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:32
yelled the word.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:35
Is it true that GM doesn't even know what the word is?

[GM] 21:36:37
I don't know what the word is. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:38
Okay.

[GM] 21:36:44
Um, okay. Uh, it goes, it… crawls incredibly smoothly, uh, due to all of its appendages, it's able to move quite quickly.

[GM] 21:36:55
Um, and it moves right up on, uh, the two closest troubleshooters, um… And… let's see…

[Dex Miro] 21:37:10
We're gonna continue the trend of NPC death.

[GM] 21:37:17
Actually, I should do this for…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:19
to be tested is. My husband, Preston, is sitting…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:24
vehicle for me.

[GM] 21:37:25
It's… Oh, it's 3 times.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:27
Interesting.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:29
You've done something wrong. You're acting like your dog.

[GM] 21:37:38
What's a troubleshooter's health.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:46
Just trying to get too much to hit, like…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:48
We have to choose something, okay? So, nice.

[GM] 21:37:56
Um… Alright.

[GM] 21:38:00
1, 2, 3, okay. Um… Despite the armor that the.

[GM] 21:38:08
the battle dress that the, um, troubleshooters are wearing.

[GM] 21:38:12
Uh, this one… Uh, one of the troubleshooters just gets, sort of, like.

[GM] 21:38:18
sliced 3 different times, uh… lopping off two of its arms, and then… Uh, it's had his head.

[Dex Miro] 21:38:25
Oh my gosh.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:25
Oh my god.

[GM] 21:38:26
Uh, blood shoots off in various different directions, um.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:29
Blood!

[GM] 21:38:31
Blood. It's not like that milky white stuff that comes out of androids, it's blood.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:36
Oh my god!

[GM] 21:38:39
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:38:40
Wait, so they're… they are, like, Cylons, not like androids?

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:44
No, they're not androids, then. If it's blood…

[GM] 21:38:46
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:38:48
But the thing stuck to him, I thought that meant Android.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:51
Oh, yeah.

[GM] 21:38:52
Boy, mysteries upon mysteries.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:54
What the hell is happening?

[Dex Miro] 21:38:55
Yeah. We spent all this time scanning each other, but we didn't scan these guys, because there's too much stuff going on.

[Murderbot V2] 21:39:02
I scanned them in my sleep.

[GM] 21:39:03
Alright. The, uh… One that's closest to the, uh… the arachnid… Well, its name is The Hunter.

[GM] 21:39:15
Uh, he, like, kicks off of the, the, uh… The creature, uh, try to push himself back away, um, firing as he goes. Uh, he's like, Frank, no! And he's, he's shooting.

[GM] 21:39:29
Meanwhile, the other one's like, oh, man! Oh, everyone needs to make a fear save.

[Murderbot V2] 21:39:35
Fuck, man. Except me!

[Dex Miro] 21:39:35
No.

[GM] 21:39:35
By the way. Except for you, that's true.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:45
Oh, dear.

[Murderbot V2] 21:39:48
Do not be afraid!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:39:48
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:39:50
Also, $94.95.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:51
Wait, why are your numbers so good? Oh, sorry. I thought that was your thresholds, not your… Yeah. Cool. Alright, literally everyone feels.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:39:55
That's bad.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:39:56
I have

[GM] 21:39:56
Yeah, everyone fails, uh… Yeah. Um… Everyone gets a point of stress.

[Ink] 21:39:59
Holy crap.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:05
I feel like that fits, like, that was pretty terrifying.

[Ink] 21:40:08
Yeah, especially my 96, since I was right next to it right now.

[GM] 21:40:13
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:40:13
But no one critical field, so that's good.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:19
Do not go afraid into that dark night.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:23
Does anything happen to us because we're afraid like that, GM, or no?

[GM] 21:40:24
The, uh… What's that?

[Dex Miro] 21:40:27
Does anything happen to us because we're afraid of that, or…

[GM] 21:40:29
No, no, no, it just increases your stress, um.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:33
Okay.

[GM] 21:40:34
I wouldn't consider… usually they call for a panic check if one of your party members dies, but.

[GM] 21:40:40
I think probably… you're not so upset that one of the troubleshooters died, I imagine?

[GM] 21:40:48
It was gruesome, but, you know, you're kind of like, well, you know, whatever that guy.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:52
Exactly.

[GM] 21:40:54
Um, okay. They are… the troubleshooter is obviously rattled, uh, by this, and, uh, their bullets go more wildly, uh… not making any kind of significant, uh, damage or impact on the hunter.

[GM] 21:41:11
Uh, okay, you guys are up.

[Ink] 21:41:15
Okay, so I'm… I'm pretty close to all this, like, potentially the next target of the spider?

[GM] 21:41:20
Uh… yeah, it's either you or the one that just kind of kicked off of it.

[Ink] 21:41:24
Okay, and he kicked off which direction?

[GM] 21:41:28
away from it, which is back towards, like, the algae… Uh, room. Back towards Zeke, where he's at.

[Ink] 21:41:34
Okay, so, um… can I… am I better than him at moving, or I don't know if I want to kick necessarily off of it, but I want to move away, I guess, as quickly as I can.

[Ink] 21:41:44
Back behind, back with the team to, I guess, grab my gun as well.

[GM] 21:41:47
Yeah, since you're just playing, like, you're not really focused on doing anything besides moving, you could definitely move faster than him.

[Ink] 21:41:53
Okay, well, the thing I did maybe want to do, besides moving was try another psionic attack.

[Ink] 21:41:59
Um, that which I was… I don't know if I can do that while I'm moving, if that would slow me down, or what the…

[GM] 21:42:05
I don't know what the… What do you think is entailed in making this attack? Like, how does… Um…

[Ink] 21:42:13
So, what do we… what did I roll last time with that?

[Ink] 21:42:18
So this is my sequence. So it's espionic feedback loop, psionic attack that overloads targeted electronics. I would say it's… the Sanity safe. I assume it takes a little focus, so I don't think I would move as quickly if I did this.

[Ink] 21:42:29
During it. So I'm not going to do it, I'm just going to move as quickly as I can to grab my weapon and get behind this guy.

[GM] 21:42:34
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Alright, you go… you move back towards the rest of the group, you got your weapon.

[Ink] 21:42:36
I think that makes sense, yeah.

[GM] 21:42:43
Um, he's definitely the… clearly the next closest target.

[GM] 21:42:54
Who's up next?

[Dex Miro] 21:43:01
I don't know if I want to try firing at it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:04
I just ran away.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:07
I mean, does it… Was there enough, like, milky white stuff coming out of the spider that we think we're accomplishing something, or are we just making it mad?

[GM] 21:43:17
Um, you definitely think you've wounded it. how many… how, you know, does it seem like it's incapacitated? No, but… some progress has been made.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:20
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:30
Alright, I guess I'll shoot it. Whatever the largest part is.

[GM] 21:43:35
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:38
So if I don't have, like. What'd you guys do, firearms or something?

[Dex Miro] 21:43:45
Yeah, I don't have that. So what do I roll? Just combat.

[GM] 21:43:52
Combat.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:52
Okay.

[GM] 21:43:57
Okay. Uh, go ahead and roll your damage.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:59
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:06
Can I do it with the pulse rifle thing here, or no? Yeah, I can.

[GM] 21:44:11
Okay, um…

[Dex Miro] 21:44:13
Is that right? 3d10?

[GM] 21:44:15
Yeah, pretty sounds right. Um, yeah, you start… shooting down the hallway with abandon, because you're like, that troubleshooter, I'm gonna shoot him anyways.

[GM] 21:44:26
Um, both the troubleshooter and, uh, the creature. Take the damage.

[Ink] 21:44:35
Sounds about right.

[GM] 21:44:40
Okay, who's up next?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:44:52
I guess I can shoot at a 2, although I…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:44:54
Skeptical I'm gonna be able to do anything.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:58
How far away are you?

[GM] 21:45:00
He's the furthest away. Oh, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:01
And…

[Dex Miro] 21:45:03
Are we between him and the spider?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:07
Well,

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:11
That's…

[Ink] 21:45:12
It's… please don't shoot deeper. Just… just play dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:13
All right. Well, I'll go… wait, is, uh, what's his name? Is Murderbot still down?

[GM] 21:45:20
Is Murderbot down? Yeah, Murderbot's town.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:21
Can I go try to… I have no idea how to reset them. Can I, like, go and try to, like, just press everywhere? I don't know.

[GM] 21:45:27
Um… I mean, do you think that, at some point.

[Ink] 21:45:28
Pressed everywhere on him, I'm excited to make that picture.

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:32
The switch is right next to the prostate.

[GM] 21:45:34
Do you think that at some point in the months that you guys have spent with each other that you might have, like, asked this question about, like, if you were to ever shut down, how could I restart you?

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:42
No, they only talked about what the word was to kill me.

[GM] 21:45:46
The only one I care about blowing you up now.

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:47
There's nothing about waking me up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:49
Well, it's related.

[GM] 21:45:53
Um, I am fine with… if you want to make it more, uh, random, and you have to, like.

[GM] 21:45:58
You know, we can roll something, or I'm fine with you just knowing the sequence to boot him up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:46:05
Um… hmm…

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:06
Right next to the on switch.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:46:08
Well, I'll leave it up to Murderabot. Murderbot, did you tell me how to restart you?

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:14
Tell you how to restart me?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:46:15
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:16
Yeah, I just reached down my pants.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:46:22
I reached down Murgabot's pants,

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:25
Go to town, baby!

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:27
No, um, there should be… there should be, um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:31
There should be, uh, like a… one of those, like, uh, you know those, like, rubber covers?

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:37
Um, for, like, uh, USB…

[GM] 21:46:40
Keeping water out and stuff.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:41
Yeah, a USB stick, like, ports and stuff like that, uh, like, behind my ear.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:48
you open that up, and there should be, like, a switch in there.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:57
What I have to do is, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:00
there's, like, a keypad, a D-pad, like a Nintendo…

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:06
like an old-school Nintendo, and you go up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:10
I go… I go to Mogabot and reach behind his ear,

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:13
And try moving his ear up twice, down twice.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:21
That was the sequence to blow me off, asshole!

[GM] 21:47:25
Alright, we heard about power's back up.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:26
I'm a… oh, hey, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

[GM] 21:47:32
Uh, Murba, your weapon is spinning as if it had just hit you in the head and was just gonna, like, all the momentum was… Turned into having it spiral.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:40
Reactively, I grabbed the… I grabbed the… I grabbed the gun.

[GM] 21:47:41
Yeah. Okay.

[GM] 21:47:46
You can do more than that with your… with your… yeah, it's… I mean, it's the team's turn, so… You see, uh, one of the troubleshooters and three different pieces, and then you see a giant spider crazy thing.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:47
Oh, it's my turn!

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:50
What's going on?!

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:53
I see the… yep.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:59
Gotcha. Um, do I see any of my, uh, team injured or anything like that, or being attacked, or no?

[GM] 21:48:06
Uh, it seems like everyone… Yeah, it seems like everyone's moving away from the spider thing, um… no one in the team seems imminently threatened because there's a… uh, troubleshooter in between you and them.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:07
We're… we are not tied up anymore, right?

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:13
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:20
Do I, like, can I… do I feel…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:23
the… the pimple on my face?

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:26
like, is there… is it, like, pain, or…?

[GM] 21:48:27
Yeah. No. It's just there.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:29
Do I, um, recognize, or am I able to…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:34
I guess, feel the, like, consciousness…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:39
Like, is that something I have to turn on, or, like, how… with the…

[GM] 21:48:43
Yeah, if you… if you concentrate, you could probably… you know, sort of, like, explore.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:47
Okay, I concentrate… it's… something weird's going on, and I feel like I'm connected to some kind of network, and I try and…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:56
kind of feel out for which…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:59
Which of these beings I can communicate with, I guess, or I can control, if possible.

[GM] 21:49:05
Yeah, you expand your consciousness, you definitely have… Um, a connection with these two troubleshooters, you're like… Clearly, um… you can kind of sense, like, their surface thoughts, which is pretty much just like, oh, we gotta get the out of here.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:20
Okay.

[GM] 21:49:21
Um, their fear, you can kind of sense their fear.

[GM] 21:49:25
Um… do you feel like maybe with, uh, you know, much more expanded effort, you might be able to, like, delve deeper into their consciousness, um… Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:36
And those are the only two.

[GM] 21:49:38
There's only two.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:39
So the other ones, I cannot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:43
Can you?

[GM] 21:49:43
Well, there's one that's shut down, right? that's, like, kind of close to you. And then the other one's in 3 different pieces.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:45
Oh, okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:48
Don't put him on their face.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:49
Oh, gotcha.

[Ink] 21:49:52
I see. Throw the one that's shut down towards the spider.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:52
But that… sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:57
Yeah, we could do that.

[Ink] 21:49:58
Maybe, but just don't let the other guys see it. Not that I think they're gonna survive this, didn't care.

[Ink] 21:50:06
I assume his weapon's floating about too, right?

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:08
I grabbed it. Or the other guy's weapon?

[GM] 21:50:11
Well, the other guy's weapon is holstered.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:20
Let's see here…

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:32
Give me a second, sir.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:35
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:38
If I take control of the other two, is that a move… is that my move too, or…?

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:45
I guess, how does it work in, like, the sequence of…

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:48
Taking control of them.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:50
Having them do moves, but they've already moved.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:53
Does that make sense?

[GM] 21:50:56
Oh, yeah, you're like, can I have their actions if they… If they've already taken their turn. Um, no, you can… You can use them, like, essentially, you could try to control one of them as part of your turn.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:59
Yeah, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:10
Gotcha. But that's a… okay, so taking control of one would be my turn, or trying to…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:16
are attempting to take control, right?

[GM] 21:51:18
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:19
Right now, as far as I can tell, I can sense them, I can kind of, like, understand or get their feelings, their emotions, but I can't really…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:26
I don't have control.

[GM] 21:51:28
Right.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:28
Okay, gotcha. Alright, well, I'll do…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:31
I'll do this as a suggestion, I'm guessing…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:35
Um… uh… are… well… how… like, when I assess the situation waking up, do I feel like we are in big trouble? Like, looking at the state of the spider creature, and…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:49
Obviously, I see a guy in three pieces, but…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:52
Um, you know, am I like, oh man, this is in a bad… we're in a bad way?

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:59
like, we're not gonna make it. Well, I mean…

[GM] 21:52:03
Um… No, yeah, you assume as long as there are, uh, troubleshooters for it to chop up, then… your team's probably fine.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:03
Oof, I don't know. I know that's a weird question to ask.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:07
trying to analyze…

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:14
Okay. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:17
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:20
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:52:22
Why don't we just get out of here, then, let it chop up the troubleshooter.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:25
Where is the door… yeah, is there… is the door behind us that we came in through, then?

[GM] 21:52:30
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:31
Okay. Then, to attempt to… and we're 0G, right?

[Ink] 21:52:32
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:36
So, attempt to kind of, like,

[GM] 21:52:36
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:40
force… give myself some force and speed going the… towards the door.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:45
I try… I'm gonna, like, push off of the…

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:49
the unconscious floating one.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:52
Um, and hopefully that pushes it toward the creature, and pushes me the opposite way toward the door.

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:58
Does that make sense?

[GM] 21:52:59
Yep, yep, I get it. Yep. Alright, you do that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:00
Yeah, yeah.

[GM] 21:53:03
The unconscious, uh, troubleshooter floats. Um, kind of, quite quickly, enough that it passes, it becomes the one that's in between.

[GM] 21:53:13
Um… the one that's… closest to the hunter right now.

[GM] 21:53:18
Um, and you get some momentum going back towards the door.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:23
The hunter is what we call the creature.

[GM] 21:53:25
Yeah, that's what I… yeah, that's its name.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:29
Along the way, can I, like, grab ahold of any of my teammates to kind of, like, also pull them?

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:35
or, like, give them, like, help drag them with me, or…?

[GM] 21:53:42
Uh, yeah, sure. Who do you want to try and grab? You can… Uh… everyone but Zeke is an option, I guess.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:42
Do I pass anyone? Yeah, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:54
who… anyone… no one's injured?

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:56
So far. Everyone has their guns.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:00
Uh, weapons?

[Dex Miro] 21:54:04
Reminder that Carnock's the only other one without zero-G training.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:08
Oh,

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:54:10
Yeah, I'm not good in Jersey.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:12
All right, well, yeah, let's grab Carnoc.

[GM] 21:54:15
Okay. Uh, I assume Carnoc's probably heavier than Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:22
No, I gotta be… I gotta be really heavy, because I'm an android? No, I don't know. I don't know what I'm made out of, but…

[Ink] 21:54:22
Murder bots made, like, feel it. Lithium ion battery.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:23
Oh.

[GM] 21:54:28
I'm gonna assume you're not. And so, you grab Carnock, you both start floating, but slower.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:29
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:37
Remember, remember, I'm trying to save your life.

[GM] 21:54:48
Alright, who's up next?

[Dex Miro] 21:54:51
So, did you actually, like, yell that you were retreating or anything?

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:57
Me? Uh…

[Dex Miro] 21:54:58
Wait, did we… didn't we all go now? Maybe?

[GM] 21:55:00
No, uh, as far as I know, Dex hasn't gone, and Carnoc hasn't gone, and Zeke.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:04
Oh, I thought I started this round with shooting.

[GM] 21:55:06
Oh, no, Zeke… Zeke went, and… turned on Murder bot.

[Ink] 21:55:09
He turned on Murder. And Indian.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:12
Yeah.

[GM] 21:55:12
So, Zeke, what you saw was Murderbot turned on, and then immediately kicked off away, and… And took… and took Karnak with him, so it is now… It's the hunter, the unconscious, uh, troubleshooter, the conscious troubleshooter.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:16
Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck is going on? And then…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:21
Thanks, Murderbot!

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:23
Whoa

[GM] 21:55:28
Then, uh… either probably… and then I think it's a pairing of Zeke and, um… And, uh, Ink, what's your character's name again?

[Dex Miro] 21:55:41
Inc.

[GM] 21:55:41
Inc. Zekend ink, and then Carnoc. Um… Or actually, Zeek Inc. And DEX.

[GM] 21:55:49
I guess they're all relatively close, and then Karnakin… Murder bottle the furthest away.

[GM] 21:55:57
Okay. Oh, it's going for you guys. I mean, whether it decides to, you know… I mean, it's probably gonna chop up the nearest threat.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:55:58
Is it looking at us currently?

[GM] 21:56:07
who knows if it'll chop up the, like… unconscious body that's sort of floating towards it.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:11
I guess the question is, do you… do we think that we can shoot this thing… shoot this thing dead, or…

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:18
Um, do we have to make a conscious effort to get all together to…

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:24
Um, to make a run for it and close the door behind us.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:56:28
Someone's pulling me down the hallway, I can shoot back at it if you want me to.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:31
Well, you know…

[Ink] 21:56:33
We also have grenades. Those will go real well, I bet.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:56:41
That is true.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:42
I… do I still have the… some crystals on me, or…?

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:47
No. Oh, I threw all of them away, okay.

[GM] 21:56:48
You threw all. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:49
Plus.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:53
Except for the one on my face.

[GM] 21:56:56
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:56
Right.

[Ink] 21:56:56
air… the guy closest to the guy, the one guy's going nuts real close, the other guy's chopped up next to… that was there as well, then the… the unconscious guy's floating towards him. What's about the fourth one?

[GM] 21:57:05
Oh yeah, where is the fourth one at? Oh, he's, uh, probably in line with the… What's the rest of you?

[GM] 21:57:14
like, ink, Dex, and Zeek, and the other conscious guy that was shooting, yeah.

[Ink] 21:57:19
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:20
Maybe he's the one that Dexter shot.

[GM] 21:57:24
Could be.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:30
So is it just Karnak was gonna shoot at him, or… No, it's whatever Carnot wants to do.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:33
Yeah, I can, if you guys want me to.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:40
Alright, I'll shoot at it.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:41
We don't have time to discuss this in a committee.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:45
Oh, that's a nice ball of weapons. Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:46
If he's looking at me, I'll shoot him.

[GM] 21:57:49
It's got at least two eyes focused on you.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:54
I'll try and shoot him in those two eyes, then.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:59
Make sure he knows what he's doing is wrong.

[GM] 21:58:01
Alright, you hit.

[GM] 21:58:09
Okay, 15… I'll start telling. Can't keep these numbers in my head.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:15
Zeke looks a little too pleased with himself in that picture.

[Ink] 21:58:19
My favorite is, I could not get the spider to attack the two guys. I had to say that the spider is hugging the guy, and they are both friends.

[Ink] 21:58:29
And it stopped rejecting it from.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:34
Why does… why does Zeke look like he's giving me a wet willy while I'm just sleeping?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:42
Oh, it's

[Dex Miro] 21:58:43
Hmm.

[GM] 21:58:46
Alright. Carnoc… blow, you know, shoot some more bullets into that… that thing, uh… You do not shoot the two eyes out.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:52
Shoot him in the face!

[GM] 21:58:56
Um, but… several more wounds open up with, you know.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:00
Grab him by the crotch and twist!

[GM] 21:59:04
Um, it moves forward to the next closest. Uh, does it ignore?

[GM] 21:59:11
No, it does not ignore the body floating towards it.

[GM] 21:59:15
Um…

[Ink] 21:59:15
But the next closest should be the guy that's still shooting wildly, right?

[GM] 21:59:19
No, no, it's the unconscious body. This robot pushed off of him.

[Ink] 21:59:20
Oh, really? How'd that guy get… oh, because the other guy… Awesome. He kicked off one, yeah.

[GM] 21:59:30
Alright. Um…

[GM] 21:59:38
So, it slices up the unconscious guy, it sort of, like, just moving down the hallway.

[GM] 21:59:42
With these limbs and these scythes. sort of, like, as it's going, and just kind of, like, chopping things, and so, um… Yeah, that… the unconscious… troubleshooter gets sliced in 3 pieces, and then, um…

[GM] 21:59:59
it gets up on the other… the next… troubleshooter and slices off his arm that's holding his weapon.

[GM] 22:00:05
Kind of like in Predator, it's still firing, but, like, totally unaimed now.

[GM] 22:00:12
Um… Yeah, there's just blood all over in the hallway.

[GM] 22:00:17
Just adding to the previous amounts of blood.

[GM] 22:00:22
Um, okay. It's troubleshooter's turn.

[GM] 22:00:27
Um… oh, everyone make a fear saves.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:31
Yeah, I guess so.

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:39
One of my… one of my… one of my rolling? Hold on.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:43
Oh, no, let the critical fail.

[GM] 22:00:44
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:45
Fear?

[Ink] 22:00:47
Oh, sure.

[GM] 22:00:49
Yeah, you do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:49
Do I roll a fear, too? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:54
Yeah, boy!

[GM] 22:00:54
Okay. So it looks like everyone succeeds except for Karnak. Um… Karnak… A critical fail. Um… What's the thing that happens to Marines when they fail, um… No.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:56
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:06
It's okay. Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:10
PTSD?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:01:13
Oh… It's… if I panic, every close, friendly player must make the fear save.

[GM] 22:01:19
Okay, um, you do panic. Well… A D20…

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:26
No, I'm holding on to Carnoc, I'm holding him! He feels… he feels safe!

[GM] 22:01:33
Um, how much stress do you have? Okay, what's a panic check. To make a pan check.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:01:36
4. Well, I guess I have… But I was just, like, counting that new failure.

[GM] 22:01:43
Roll a panic die and attempt a roll greater than your current stress.

[GM] 22:01:46
So, 3 is less than your current stress. That's a D20. That's what you just rolled.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:01:49
It's a panic day.

[GM] 22:01:54
Um… No, no, no, no, no, this… you're doing the panic check right here.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:01:55
the role again, you know.

[GM] 22:02:00
Um… I was gonna say, so 3 is probably lower than your… Yeah, okay. So that means you become jumpy.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:02
That's probably not greater than a stress.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:02:05
It's Leslie, yeah.

[GM] 22:02:10
You gain one stress. all closed crew members, uh, which is Murderbot.

[GM] 22:02:16
And I would say everyone's close here. Uh, so everyone else gains 2 stress.

[GM] 22:02:23
And then on top of that, everyone needs to make another fear save, because… Carnoc… panicked a little bit.

[Ink] 22:02:23
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:29
Me too?

[Dex Miro] 22:02:31
Wait, so we all got too stressed, and then we also do it on the first half?

[GM] 22:02:31
Yep. Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:35
Okay.

[Ink] 22:02:35
Yeah, it's crazy. Oh, dang. I'm getting stressed out.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:37
Oh, shite.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:41
Oh, shite!

[Dex Miro] 22:02:44
Yeah, that one's not going well. Alright, so everyone failed.

[GM] 22:02:48
Alright, everyone just gets… yeah, everyone failed, but everyone gets more stress.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:48
I don't want us.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:53
Yeah.

[GM] 22:02:56
Uh, Karnak, make sure you keep track that you are now jumpy.

[GM] 22:02:59
This is a persistent… persistent, uh… Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:03:01
What… what does that mean?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:03:04
Ah, it's persistent.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:06
Absolute shite.

[GM] 22:03:08
You can… you can, with enough money, you can… you can… sort of heal these things, but…

[Ink] 22:03:15
Or that lady's gonna take us to her God thing, and he's gonna make everything right.

[GM] 22:03:19
Yeah, maybe. If you survive that long. I forgot that she's with you, uh, I guess she… Yeah, like, what has she been doing?

[Dex Miro] 22:03:24
Oh my gosh.

[Ink] 22:03:26
Yeah, that's right, what he's been doing this whole time.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:28
Oh, yeah, what has she been doing?

[GM] 22:03:30
She's been praying to the Minotaur. Come save us, Minotaur, come save us!

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:32
Oh, fuck.

[Dex Miro] 22:03:32
Yeah, she's… she's probably been talking to the spider again. Have you heard the Minotaur's greatness?

[GM] 22:03:36
Yeah. Yeah. Um… She did unload when it was just a troubleshooters, but this thing, she's freaking out, I guess.

[GM] 22:03:45
That's it. She's panicked, uh, she's… she's in line with, uh, we'll say with… Zeek, Inc, and Dex, and the last troubleshooter that… or the last armed troubleshooter.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:47
Uh-oh.

[GM] 22:03:56
Um, okay, so I did…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:03:59
What does Jumpy do? Does it, like, affect my roles or anything?

[GM] 22:04:01
No, no, it's just… just your… It's now, after having had the mechanical effect in this system a year of just, like, these, uh, extra fear saves everyone had to make.

[GM] 22:04:11
It's now more just for you to role-play with, that, like… You know… Um… okay, so then it's everybody else's turn now.

[Ink] 22:04:26
So, right now, Dex and I are pretty much next to each other with, um… whoever her name is.

[GM] 22:04:33
Dex, Zeek and, um… Inc. Are all next to each other, as well as the her and the other troubleshooter, yeah.

[Ink] 22:04:33
And there's only one…

[Dex Miro] 22:04:37
Very cool.

[Ink] 22:04:38
Gotcha. Okay, the other troubleshooter is standing next to us, and he… and so… And then they're… there still is the troubleshooter that… well, okay, but there should be two troubleshooters left still, right?

[GM] 22:04:42
All 5 of your…

[GM] 22:04:51
There is one, but his arms got cut off, and he has no weapon.

[GM] 22:04:54
So, I'm not really counting him. Two are sliced into three pieces, and one has one arm missing.

[Ink] 22:04:56
Wait, so 3 troubleshooters got hit by the spider?

[Ink] 22:05:02
Oh, gotcha. So the spider got two of them in one move.

[GM] 22:05:04
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:05:05
I see. And the one that's… the one that's what are missing, where's he at?

[Dex Miro] 22:05:06
Yeah.

[GM] 22:05:10
He's still closer to the thing.

[Ink] 22:05:16
Yeah, the last one.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:16
So it's… so this is, like, the next round now, yeah, okay, yeah.

[GM] 22:05:19
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:21
So, am I near Narrico? If… if I can, like, grab onto a wall and her, can I just, like… throw her back at the entrance, because I'm assuming she has no idea how to get herself out of the situation.

[GM] 22:05:23
Yes.

[GM] 22:05:34
Yeah, I think that's fair to do. I'll also… that's… that takes you very little time, given your training.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:41
Okay. I would also like to… push off and head towards the entrance where we came in.

[GM] 22:05:48
Um, what do you want to push off against? You want to just, like… you can either give yourself some extra speed, you could try to take somebody with you, or you could, like, try to push the troubleshooter that's still firing closer to the thing.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:00
That seems like a dick move. I'm not gonna do that with a troubleshooter.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:03
What the hell does that make me, motherfuckers?

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:07
Oh my god!

[Ink] 22:06:10
A murder bot. I mean…

[Dex Miro] 22:06:14
I mean, I… Dex actually hasn't seen some of the terrible things that you've done, but… But anyways… Um, oh, should I grab somebody on the way? Well, Zeke's pretty much at the entrance, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:14
son of a bitch.

[GM] 22:06:29
No, no, Zeke's up with you guys, because he went to turn on Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:32
Oh, right, right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:32
And I just left him behind.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:33
Murderabot.

[GM] 22:06:35
I was left behind.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:40
Alright, then I guess I'll… Crubs, so you can, like, see if I can, like, kick off the side of the hallway and push myself back towards the entrance and with him.

[GM] 22:06:48
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:48
But that's… you did say… wait, so you said Zeke does have Z row G…

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:54
skill, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:06:55
I don't think so. Doesn't… I don't think so.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:56
Oh, he doesn't? Oh.

[GM] 22:06:57
No, he's a scientist.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:59
Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Zeke.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:59
Yeah. Yeah, that's why Pixie.

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:04
Hey, listen, if there's… of all the… of all of you, uh, there's one person who can call me to die, or blow me up…

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:12
I'm gonna save that guy first. I mean, come on.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:15
Uh-huh.

[Ink] 22:07:16
No, wait, wait, so Dex, you didn't save Norelco, you saved Zeke?

[GM] 22:07:19
No, he did. He pushed her towards the… the… opposite direction of the creature, and then he also grabs Zeke and started moving with Zeke.

[Ink] 22:07:27
Oh, wow, okay, so he took care of both of them.

[GM] 22:07:30
Kind of. I mean, there's an element of, like.

[GM] 22:07:34
you know, if you focus on just moving yourself, you're gonna move a lot faster, but this means that, like, Zeke can do something else and be moved on his turn.

[Ink] 22:07:44
Okay. Um… So then all that's left is me in the troubleshooters, the ink in the troubleshooter up there?

[GM] 22:07:50
It's… you… Yeah, there's a… yeah. Yeah, it's just you and the other troubleshooter at this point.

[Ink] 22:07:51
Well, actually, two troubles, a disarmed one.

[Ink] 22:07:58
And the disarmed one, he's dead. Or just reading out.

[GM] 22:07:59
And, yeah, you… So sorry. What's that? The one that's lost his arm?

[Ink] 22:08:06
Yeah, the one that's lost his arm, what is he doing?

[GM] 22:08:09
He's screaming and just spinning around in circles, probably.

[GM] 22:08:13
It's blood, blood just shooting out of his armhole.

[Ink] 22:08:13
Okay. Gotcha. Can I grab him and throw a grenade and move back, or is that, like…

[GM] 22:08:19
Oh, wait, you want to move up to get him? He's, like, right next to the one that's lost… yeah.

[Ink] 22:08:23
Oh, he's right next to Twitter, gotcha. No, never mind.

[GM] 22:08:26
You could maybe kick off and take the other troubleshooter with you.

[Ink] 22:08:29
Yeah, I'm thinking, can I… can I throw a grenade, kick off, and take the other troubleshoot, or is that too much?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:36
I'll be right back goes. Evan, you need to…

[GM] 22:08:36
Um… I think that's fine. I think that's fine.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:41
I need to go to bed, sweetie.

[Ink] 22:08:44
So I need to roll something to throw the grenade.

[Ink] 22:08:47
What do I roll on that?

[GM] 22:08:47
Yeah. Yeah, you're wrong, uh… combat.

[Ink] 22:08:52
Combat. No, why not strength or speed? Great. All right.

[GM] 22:08:58
Um, because it requires some precision and 0G with the fact that.

[Ink] 22:09:01
It's just come back to my… combat's my worst, and I'm, like, way high in strength and speed. No, that makes a lot of sense. Alright, combat, here we go.

[GM] 22:09:06
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:09:12
Oh, wow. Almost. Almost.

[GM] 22:09:14
Almost. Um… Alright, um… Yeah, you take the grenade, um… you throw it… down towards, uh, where the troubleshooter and the creature are.

[GM] 22:09:30
Um…

[Ink] 22:09:31
And it's… it's an EMP grenade.

[GM] 22:09:34
Yeah. Um… But as… as you, uh… as you, like, go to turn to grab the other, uh, guy, you accidentally push him closer towards… Uh, the blast.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:35
Oh, see you later. Bye-bye.

[Ink] 22:09:47
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:09:49
You're like, come on! And then, like, you, like, hit him, like, you, like, reach behind you, and you, like, hit him, and he, like, starts floating towards the… the blast, uh… Um…

[GM] 22:10:06
Okay. Uh… There's a… what would it… There's a sort of a loud pop.

[GM] 22:10:17
It's like, uh, and… With that, the, um… you see the troubleshooter's, um… they, like, start to, like.

[GM] 22:10:29
clearly, like, shake, uh, and… I mean, looks like they're kind of having seizures.

[GM] 22:10:36
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:37
Go ask Mom, I'm playing. I'm hugging! Oh, hugging.

[GM] 22:10:40
Let's see…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:44
I'm not gonna eat them.

[GM] 22:10:51
Um…

[GM] 22:10:56
Where's this? Where's that? There it is. Okay.

[GM] 22:11:01
The, um…

[GM] 22:11:05
Okay. The creature… Um… part of it, uh, vibrates and… Uh… Look to be disabled. Let's see…

[GM] 22:11:24
7… Uh… 1.

[GM] 22:11:27
Uh, two of its, um… It's scything arm things, uh, seem to be disabled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:34
Whoa.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:36
Oh, so both the creature and the troubleshooter are, like, shaking?

[GM] 22:11:39
Well, all… both… the two technically alive troubleshooters. are affected by it. They're just completely out.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:44
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:11:47
Uh, and the creature, like, two of its, like, scything arms are… are disabled. I have to go. Hold on one second.

[Ink] 22:11:56
I don't know if that was a good move or not.

[Ink] 22:12:01
I probably should have waited until the last troubleshooter got taken.

[Ink] 22:12:05
Now, before I threw that.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:07
Oh, because they were, like, distracting and damaging each other.

[Ink] 22:12:09
Yeah, because now that they're disabled, um, he may not go after them.

[Ink] 22:12:13
Now, he's disabled, so I don't know how quickly he can move the spider.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:17
Only 2 of them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:19
Two out of how many? I don't know.

[Ink] 22:12:21
Well, two of them are dead. One of them has missed.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:22
No, no, his legs.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:25
the spiders…

[Ink] 22:12:27
Oh, the spider, yeah. Yeah, so he might be slower.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:28
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:12:30
Um, is all. But now we've… now he's… I'm the… I'm the most live thing towards him, I guess, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:38
Yeah. I guess you draw a lot of attention to yourself just now.

[GM] 22:12:58
Okay, I'm back. Alright, so… Um… Yeah, you said you wanted a shotgun.

[Ink] 22:13:06
I got a shotgun? I do have a shotgun.

[GM] 22:13:11
Um… Who else is left on this turn?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:20
Did I go?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:22
Or is that last turn?

[GM] 22:13:25
I don't think you've gone. Murder… or not murder, but, um, Dex is pulling you along.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:29
Okay. Which is probably fine.

[GM] 22:13:35
I mean, you could do something as you're being pulled along.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:37
That's okay, I'll just get pulled.

[GM] 22:13:40
Okay.

[GM] 22:13:45
Uh… is there anybody else?

[Ink] 22:13:53
or alcove, or whatever the name is.

[GM] 22:13:55
Yeah, she's just bringing to the Minotaur.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:58
Did Karnak do something this round?

[GM] 22:14:00
I don't think so, I think it's being pulled by Murderbot. He got jumpy, but… That's only because the… The fear save, right?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:14:07
Okay. Well, I'm definitely gonna shoot again now.

[GM] 22:14:10
Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:14:20
I don't know.

[GM] 22:14:22
Okay. Um… This is your SMG.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:23
Oh dear.

[GM] 22:14:32
Um… Go ahead and do your damage.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:39
I recommend rolling low.

[GM] 22:14:43
He did. Um… your gun jams.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:52
Oh, Jesus.

[GM] 22:14:57
Okay. Yeah, he shot it. He, like, fired off a few rounds.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:58
Did he hit anything? Okay.

[GM] 22:15:03
Um, uh, but… Uh, it jammed.

[GM] 22:15:07
Um… No, so everybody… everybody took a turn then?

[GM] 22:15:13
Yes.

[GM] 22:15:17
Alright, um… The, uh, troubleshooters are disabled, but… easy targets for the… Um… the creature, it just slices through the other two of them.

[GM] 22:15:30
Uh, and then moves down the hallway. It's still… Uh, because of all of its extra limbs and such, it's still moving.

[GM] 22:15:38
quite a bit faster in its size. Um, than you guys, it's gonna be hard to… Hard to escape without really accelerating.

[Ink] 22:15:47
So I didn't really slow it down.

[GM] 22:15:50
Uh, you didn't slow it down, but it seems less… capable in combat.

[Ink] 22:15:55
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:15:59
instead of 6 size, it only has 4 now.

[GM] 22:16:07
Okay, uh, it's your guy's turn.

[GM] 22:16:14
Oh, let me… let me re… give you a sense of who's… who's in what position.

[GM] 22:16:18
Uh, it'll be ink. Then… Uh… ducks and, um… Zeke, and then Karnak, and… Murder bot.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:34
Did Rico get…

[GM] 22:16:38
Uh… I guess she only got… she kind of got pushed, so I guess she's still.

[GM] 22:16:43
in line with, um… Dex and ink.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:50
Okay.

[GM] 22:16:52
Yeah. Oh, sorry, Dex and Zeke.

[GM] 22:16:57
Zeke, yeah. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:57
6. C, yeah.

[Ink] 22:17:03
and I shoot and grab her, and move back.

[Ink] 22:17:12
Am I muted? Sorry.

[GM] 22:17:13
Um, no, no, no, I heard you. I'm just thinking through. Uh, no. You can accelerate yourself, so you're kind of in line with them.

[GM] 22:17:23
Because you're not moving very fast at this point, like, backwards.

[Ink] 22:17:27
Okay. So I can sorry myself and chew, or no?

[GM] 22:17:30
Yes, yeah. Go ahead and make a compat check.

[Ink] 22:17:40
And I'm still at range, so I want to use… an SMG, right? Not a… not a combat shotgun.

[GM] 22:17:47
I don't know, what's the range on? You're close to this thing.

[Ink] 22:17:47
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:17:51
It said… oh, it is combat shotgun, but I have type range, that doesn't make sense.

[Ink] 22:17:56
the Treasurer range or melee.

[GM] 22:18:01
Um, the range on a combat shotgun? Close. You could use your combat shotgun.

[Ink] 22:18:07
Okay, let's do the shotgun. Actually, I don't know what damage it does or anything like that.

[GM] 22:18:10
4010.

[Ink] 22:18:12
Or each hip. Alright. Combat shotgun, here we go.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:13
Sure, alright.

[GM] 22:18:20
Okay. Why is it red on the 20th? Because you rolled two nines?

[Ink] 22:18:24
It's amazing.

[GM] 22:18:26
Okay, um… You… you burn through an entire clip, you just… Um…

[Ink] 22:18:40
Well, I shoot for, uh…

[GM] 22:19:02
Um, you…

[Ink] 22:19:09
Out of 3 rounds a shot.

[GM] 22:19:10
Yeah. You basically… uh, damage one of its arms, it's now much slower.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:20
Like, this is like a walking arm, not a scythe arm.

[Ink] 22:19:20
Yeah…

[GM] 22:19:23
Yeah. Here's… I gotta make these interpretations, it's like, you wounded it.

[GM] 22:19:31
Uh, the wound effect was grazed slash knocked down, and I'm like.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:31
Yeah.

[GM] 22:19:36
What does knockdown mean in 0G? Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:39
Right.

[GM] 22:19:44
Alright. Who's up next?

[Dex Miro] 22:20:00
Like our… how close are we getting to the door? Like, I know you gave us our, kind of, relative ordering, but… It's gonna take a few turns to get there.

[GM] 22:20:12
I have to reorient myself with… Okay, you guys are in 59…

[GM] 22:20:21
B…

[GM] 22:20:25
Um…

[GM] 22:20:29
takes approximately 10 minutes to cross. So again, you were probably halfway down.

[GM] 22:20:34
When you got to the intersection… So, um… You probably need, like, another, uh… two turns of floating at the rate you guys are going?

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:45
Shit.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:47
And I'm floating, so, like, there's nothing I could do at this point.

[GM] 22:20:50
You can let go of Zeke and accelerate yourself.

[GM] 22:20:55
Maybe get their… I mean, he would still be moving, he just wouldn't be moving very fast.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:56
By pushing Zeke back at…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:58
Hey!

[Dex Miro] 22:21:03
No, I guess I'm just gonna… Turn around and try to shoot at the creature while I'm floating away from it.

[GM] 22:21:10
Okay, uh, there…

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:11
That does… that should help you, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:21:11
Although… I don't know how much, but yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:15
go… go a little bit faster, right? No?

[Dex Miro] 22:21:18
Sir Isaac Newton says so.

[GM] 22:21:20
He does. There is an ally in between you and… and it.

[Dex Miro] 22:21:25
Alright, it's just… it's ink, right? Or… Okay, and he's, like, directly in the line of the creature.

[GM] 22:21:27
Yep, it's Inc. No, I mean, you could reach around and, you know, maybe try to avoid them, it's just there's a chance.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:37
GM, I'm… I know I might be too late,

[GM] 22:21:37
You know…

[Ink] 22:21:39
I'm bulletproof, don't worry, Jax.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:40
Oh, wait, GM, this last…

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:44
round of fear.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:45
everybody took additional something? I missed that, sorry.

[GM] 22:21:50
Yeah, the… yeah, you took it. from Carnax failing his panic check, you took a total of, essentially, 3.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:50
Additional stress?

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:58
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:21:59
Three fear. You got all that, then you're good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:02
Alright, I'm at 6 now. But, um, going back to that, had… could I… is there a way to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:10
spread…

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:12
stress and distribute it among the people I'm connected, among the beings I'm connected with, or anything like that, or no?

[Ink] 22:22:18
I like that question.

[GM] 22:22:19
Yeah, yeah, I think that maybe you could have, like.

[GM] 22:22:23
focused it into them, maybe, uh, if they had been alive at the time.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:27
Okay.

[GM] 22:22:27
I guess maybe one of them was… wait, when did it kill them?

[GM] 22:22:31
This was our… No, they're all… they're all chopped.

[Ink] 22:22:33
One of them's still live right now, right? Or he just got chopped up. Yeah, so he just got chopped up this round, so…

[GM] 22:22:37
Yeah, yeah. Okay, alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:38
Yeah. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:40
I should have thought of that earlier, my bad.

[GM] 22:22:44
Yeah, in the future, yes, I would say. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:46
Okay.

[Ink] 22:22:48
That's a cool question, Murderbot. Boom.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:51
It's too late! It's too late!

[Ink] 22:22:55
I love it.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:56
Alright, well, I guess Inc. Said it's okay, so I'm gonna try to shoot it with my pulse rifle.

[GM] 22:23:00
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:04
Here goes an elephant. Oh, dear.

[Ink] 22:23:06
Inspiring you. Holy crap. Oh my god, I'm dead.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:13
Oh my goodness.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:13
Hey, it's not a critical failure. No, no.

[GM] 22:23:15
Um… it is not a critical failure.

[Ink] 22:23:15
hot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:15
Oh my god.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:18
Oh my god, God!

[Ink] 22:23:20
Oh. Uh-huh.

[GM] 22:23:23
Um, okay. Uh… Let's see, uh…

[Ink] 22:23:29
blows a hole in the space station, and…

[GM] 22:23:32
Everyone sucked off the vacuum. All right, um… Yeah, you pull out your pulse rifle, you're, like, slinging it off your shoulder while you're holding Zeke, and you accidentally throw your weapon at the creature, and it slices your weapon in half.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:47
I don't know. Alright, so no more pulse rifle.

[GM] 22:23:51
Yeah, no more bullse rifles. No.

[Ink] 22:23:52
Wait, did I take any damage in that? Okay, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:53
Alright. Not unless it barked you on the head on the way.

[GM] 22:23:58
Yeah, yeah.

[GM] 22:24:05
Karnak, you've never seen such. tomfoolery with other train… you're wishing for, like, trained marines around you right now.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:15
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:17
Your stress turns to rage.

[GM] 22:24:17
This Teamster guy just threw his gun.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:20
Your stress turns to rage, and fear turns to rage!

[Dex Miro] 22:24:25
Hey, as long as it's my gut and not my Spanner, I'm still fine.

[GM] 22:24:36
Okay. Who's up next?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:40
I guess. Can I do anything to try and jam my gun?

[GM] 22:24:43
Yeah, yeah, you can spend your turn just on jamming it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:47
Do you have to roll anything for that?

[GM] 22:24:48
Nope, you're trained in this.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:54
Alright, I'll do that then.

[GM] 22:24:55
Okay. Um, and so Zeke and… Uh, Murder bot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:05
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:09
what the hell to do here?

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:12
What do I got?

[Dex Miro] 22:25:19
So what happens with carnaxone? He just has to work on it for a bit.

[GM] 22:25:23
Yeah, just let's unjam it.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:25
Yeah, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:42
I don't feel any of them, because they're all dead now.

[GM] 22:25:47
Yeah. You don't feel any of them. Loneliness sets in your friends.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:52
What is the… what is the order again now of… of the closest to tour?

[GM] 22:25:53
Your companions. Inc. Is the closest.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:00
And then…

[GM] 22:26:02
And then, um… Dex and Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:09
And then…

[GM] 22:26:10
And Nariko. Actually, no, wait, no, Ink, you accelerate yourself. Okay, no, it's ink… Dex, Zeke, and Nariko.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:12
There we go.

[GM] 22:26:20
Then Murderbot and Carnock.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:23
Karnok.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:25
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:29
Do I feel the creature at all, or no?

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:31
That's not a thing.

[Ink] 22:26:33
You didn't put purple things on it.

[GM] 22:26:35
Yeah, I don't… I think you threw the purple things before it showed up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:38
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:26:42
Well, let's roll a chance that maybe it, like, brushed up against one as it's been doing this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:45
Yeah…

[GM] 22:26:46
Alright. What do we think? Probably, like, 20% chance it's happened. So… Well, call two-no numbers at 1 through 10.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:50
Okay. I like those, uh…

[Ink] 22:26:50
Alright, so it goes on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:55
1 through 10, I'll call 4 and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:59
6.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:01
Damn it! I was gonna say 8!

[GM] 22:27:07
It does not have one.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:09
Fuck.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:11
Um, uh, weapons-wise, uh, the grenades and all that stuff, they're floating, or no, they're nowhere near, everybody took them. All I have is my gun, or whatever my weapon is.

[GM] 22:27:23
Do you have all of your weapons that you had previously?

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:25
Let's see, what did I have before?

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:31
Um, it's not good, because it says I have a penknife and two clips.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:38
Where the fuck did my gun go? Did I not pick up a gun?

[Ink] 22:27:38
Good night.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:42
Oh, no…

[GM] 22:27:44
I can't keep track of it for you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:46
Shit.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:49
No, I did grab a gun, though, didn't I? Like, I thought I said I grabbed a gun. The first thing that was…

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:56
that I did was grab a gun.

[GM] 22:27:59
Do you not, like… why do you have nothing on your sheet?

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:02
I don't know, man. I have no idea.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:06
No clue.

[GM] 22:28:08
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:11
Can I just say I did grab a gun, a pulse rifle, and that's what I have on me, or…

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:17
Will you allow that, or…? Okay.

[GM] 22:28:19
Yeah, I mean, I assume… I basically said, okay.

[GM] 22:28:24
Everyone should have, basically, uh… a two-handed weapon, and then they can have a sidearm.

[GM] 22:28:29
Which would be a largest SMG, but, like, a pistolor or something like that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:30
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:34
Okay.

[GM] 22:28:34
And then you could carry 4 small items beyond that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:37
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:40
Alright, I'm gonna say right…

[GM] 22:28:41
Because you have this big, heavy back… everyone's got a big, heavy backpack on them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:44
I'm gonna say rifle and SMG.

[GM] 22:28:47
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:47
Alright, um, I'm going to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:52
The problem is I suck at shooting.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:56
in combat in gen… in general,

[GM] 22:28:59
Yeah, what's the worst?

[Ink] 22:29:00
converter product and combatants.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:01
I mean, if… if ink needs a pulse rifle, there's one flying path that's had about now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:01
Huh?

[Ink] 22:29:06
Yeah. I got my shotgun, it did well.

[GM] 22:29:09
Uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:29:11
That's true, it was pretty good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:13
No, I'm just trying to think, because Carnoc is the closest now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:18
Um, it's…

[Ink] 22:29:19
No, before you back.

[GM] 22:29:19
No, no, ink is… well, ink, dex, Zeek, and… No. Ink, tax, Zeek, and… Nariko are all closest to the creature. Karnak and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:21
No, I mean, it's closest to the creature.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:24
No? Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:30
Oh, to the creature, I thought you were saying they were closest to the door.

[GM] 22:29:33
Exit? No. No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:34
Oh, okay, okay, okay, so reverse, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:37
Oh, okay, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:42
Shoot, then, huh?

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:43
How do we… how do we get these? Where's the rope?

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:46
GM, that we were all tethered to.

[GM] 22:29:49
it's cut, and probably… Yeah, you guys have been moving away from it ever since the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:49
Oh, it's cut, and just in pieces, not like a… there…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:56
Shit. How far away is the creature?

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:59
Again, from all, like, the bunch of us.

[GM] 22:30:00
Um…

[GM] 22:30:05
Uh, assuming that no one in the other… Grouping accelerates, it probably will be able to get to them next… Next turn.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:12
Oh, okay. And then, um, once… once, like, one of the… the… the trouble, whatever, shooters are dead,

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:22
Does the… does it seem like that the creature just moves on to the next thing, and the next thing? It doesn't sit there, try and, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:28
Wrap it up, or try to extract anything from it, or sits there and chews on it and eats it, or anything like that, or…

[GM] 22:30:35
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it does that, no.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:36
Oh, so it just kills and goes on, kills and goes on.

[GM] 22:30:39
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:40
Fuck.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:47
Well, today…

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:49
Hmm…

[Ink] 22:30:51
Advertise.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:54
Guess that's all I can do right now. I mean, other than if I can try and esperanetic feedback, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:01
The thing is that…

[Ink] 22:31:02
I don't think there's anything to asprenetic anymore. I don't think there's anything to aspirinetic anymore on it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:04
What's up?

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:08
Oh, it's, uh, okay.

[Ink] 22:31:10
at Friday with an EMP. Yes, I could.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:11
Yeah, you've fried the legs and stuff with it, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:17
Alright.

[GM] 22:31:19
I don't know what your Esprin Act feedback does.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:21
Uh, psionic attack that overloads targeted electronics, including Android cybernetics, etc., etc., make a sanity save, excessive,

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:29
Deal damage equal to the amount rolled on failure, take 1 damage and gain…

[GM] 22:31:33
Oh, no, you could do that. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:34
I can.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:36
Against this thing?

[GM] 22:31:38
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:38
Oh, let's do it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:44
Um, the role I do with sanity, say, role?

[GM] 22:31:48
I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:52
Right? Yeah, make a synergy save.

[Ink] 22:31:52
You make the entity save, it… That will deal damage equal to the amount rolled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:55
plus… whoa, what does that mean? Make a sanity save?

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:59
Plus, if successful,

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:01
Deal damage equal to…

[GM] 22:32:02
If there's a plus, it usually means with advantage.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:05
Yeah, alright, same with advantage.

[Ink] 22:32:07
Oh, really, I didn't get an advantage when I tried that the first time, shoot.

[GM] 22:32:11
Sorry?

[Ink] 22:32:13
That's my fault, no.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:14
If successful, damage equal to the amount rolled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:18
On failure, take 1 damage, and gain 1 stress as per usual. Alright. No modifiers, I'm guessing.

[GM] 22:32:25
No, saves don't generally have not fires.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:28
Oh, my fuck!

[GM] 22:32:31
Well, you have advantage, so it's 50. Oh. Well, that's still… still a failure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:32
It still doesn't…

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:34
So, I take…

[GM] 22:32:36
So you take a stress…

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:37
another stress, and…

[GM] 22:32:40
And nothing happens, as far as I know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:41
Okay. Son of a bitch.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:45
Can I move, or no?

[Ink] 22:32:47
takes one damage.

[GM] 22:32:48
Oh, you take a damage, there you go.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:49
I'll take a damage? Okay. 7.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:52
Down to 7 people.

[GM] 22:32:55
Um, yeah, I mean, you keep moving, but you're not moving very fast.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:58
Yeah.

[GM] 22:33:03
Uh, Zeke?

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:06
I, like, vibrate, and people are like, what the fuck is wrong with them?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:10
I'm still being carried.

[GM] 22:33:16
You are indeed being carried.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:16
Sorry, I missed some of what happened. I had to go upstairs. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:21
the thing's still there.

[GM] 22:33:23
Mm-hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:24
I will turn around and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:26
Swim?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:27
pull… my pulse rifle and shoot it while I'm being carried, I guess, this time?

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:30
Oh, ho, lucky, looky.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:30
I don't know, I'll give it a go.

[GM] 22:33:30
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:39
Um, I haven't shot anything in so long.

[GM] 22:33:43
That's a combat check.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:44
Let's see…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:47
You know, so always goes badly.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:53
I mean, just keep a good grip on your weapon.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:57
Ah, keep them good.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:02
Oh, dear.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:04
you know, why don't do that?

[GM] 22:34:06
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:07
Build a ban layer…

[Dex Miro] 22:34:11
Sorry, what was… What was Murabout's roll again?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:15
My roll? Oh, the Espernetic Feedback Loop.

[GM] 22:34:16
Espernetic Feedback for sanity saved?

[Dex Miro] 22:34:18
Okay. But what did… but what was the impact on them? Nothing?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:21
Did I horribly, horribly rolled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:26
Impact on me?

[Dex Miro] 22:34:26
Because you fail. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:28
Um, I took a stress and a damage.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:31
Okay.

[GM] 22:34:37
Um…

[GM] 22:34:45
Alright, uh… Yeah, you… you shoot around wildly, um… Who gave a scientist a pulse rifle?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:47
Whew.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:51
So what I do…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:56
Yeah.

[GM] 22:34:57
Um… Yeah, you unload your entire clip, uh, without hitting anything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:03
Oh my god.

[Ink] 22:35:04
Pulp fiction style.

[GM] 22:35:04
Actually, not without hitting anything. Go ahead and do your damage.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:07
Oh my giddy art.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:10
What's my damage?

[Ink] 22:35:12
Uh, uh-oh.

[GM] 22:35:13
3D10.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:16
You can click on the weapon if you have it in the attacks column.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:22
Do I?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:23
Yeah, that's…

[Ink] 22:35:24
Oh yeah, you should have just shot with that, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:30
Did I do the right thing.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:32
I don't know what it did.

[Ink] 22:35:37
That's a lot down.

[GM] 22:35:40
I don't… I don't see anything.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:41
No, nothing popped up, alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:44
Well, it should, like, ask you to confirm something, and then… Okay.

[GM] 22:35:48
Okay. Alright, um, you do… you hit it only a couple of times, um… So it's not quite as effective.

[GM] 22:35:57
And you burn through an entire clip. Um… let's go ricocheting down the hall.

[GM] 22:36:09
Um… Great.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:11
So it does hit this feature some, or no?

[GM] 22:36:12
Yeah, he does. He hits it with a couple bullets.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:16
Alright, just a few hit the screen sharing.

[GM] 22:36:19
Um… You find… Zeke, you find your Zeke… I should say, Zeke finds that it's very difficult to control a pulse rifle in 0G.

[GM] 22:36:30
It's like, boy. Wish I had either some weapons training and or zero D shaming.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:37
trans scientists and anything.

[GM] 22:36:38
Um… Alright, on its turn. Um… it retreats.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:47
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:49
No way…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:50
I scared it off.

[GM] 22:36:50
Um, and… Instead of attacking, um, with its scything arms, it uses them to accelerate itself down the hallway and.

[GM] 22:36:59
Uh, around the corner. Um, it gets out of sight pretty quickly.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:05
Whoa.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:07
That…

[GM] 22:37:08
Actually, what it does… actually, this is what it does. It leverages its backend and shoots a steel wire.

[GM] 22:37:15
Um, down the hall, and then basically coils itself.

[GM] 22:37:20
Um, using the wire to… To accelerate itself down the hallway.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:25
So, it's Spider-Man itself out of there.

[GM] 22:37:27
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:32
Damn.

[GM] 22:37:32
I will be right back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:35
What the hell do you think happened there?

[Ink] 22:37:36
Um… GM just is being nice this year.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:55
So the… even the last troubleshooter got sliced in pieces, right?

[Ink] 22:38:00
I think so.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:02
No.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:11
Guess we might as well search third-party corpses and see if we can learn anything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:16
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:38:20
Um, we got some impacts and stuff. Who has injuries?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:20
Works for me.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:24
What's up? Oh, I need, I need a Stimpact. I need to, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:28
I'm at half my health.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:33
Anybody else?

[Ink] 22:38:36
I've only taken one damage, so, um… I can… I can use… do you have a stent pack, or you want to use my Stimpack on you?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:42
High risk impact, I think. Yeah, I think I have it on my list of stuff I have a stimpak.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:53
I use my stamp pack…

[Ink] 22:38:55
Murderbot, do you watch the, uh, season finale of the Mighty Nine?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:58
Yes.

[Ink] 22:39:00
Good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:02
Um, a lot of stuff went down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:07
And…

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:09
It left us hanging.

[Ink] 22:39:13
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:14
And they didn't even touch one of the characters.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:18
about, like, any… like, they didn't do any, like, I guess now…

[Ink] 22:39:21
Right? I was like, wait a whole time for her to get there, and then, like, the very end, she finally is part of the gang now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:25
Yeah. That was weird.

[Ink] 22:39:27
Um, what about the, uh… What about the… so the… I forget what the guy's name is, he's, uh, Molly, right? The chick that confronts Molly, what do you think happened to her?

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:33
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:36
Yeah, it looks like, I mean, animation-wise, it looks like she completely disintegrated, but…

[Ink] 22:39:43
She seemed, like, way powerful, and like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:44
That too, yeah, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:48
We'll find out next… next season!

[Ink] 22:39:50
What was it? That main wizard dude was a badass.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:54
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:57
I mean, he was badass to begin with, but then, like, just to watch him take down, like,

[Ink] 22:40:00
Yeah. We finally have to see him turn it on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:02
an elite squad of…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:04
of the Korean, or whatever.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:07
was pretty cool.

[Ink] 22:40:08
I think that… Yeah.

[GM] 22:40:08
You guys talk about Mighty Nine? Or whatever.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:09
Yeah, that was a pretty cool battle.

[Ink] 22:40:12
You need to actually meet the traveler, though, right? That was… Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:13
Oh, yeah, the traveler. The traveler!

[GM] 22:40:19
Okay, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:21
I took a Stimpak, what do you roll for Stimpaks?

[GM] 22:40:28
Uh, Stimpak is…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:32
Do you roll anything for Stempix?

[GM] 22:40:33
Yeah, and there's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:39
Wait, do I do anything for Stimpact? Like, I literally just have to get circuitry, like, re-re…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:45
like, uh…

[GM] 22:40:48
Here's cryo sickness, reduced stress by one, restores health 1D10, and grants advantages, uh, to all roles for 1 to 10 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:51
Okay, R1D10.

[GM] 22:40:58
Okay. Uh… reduce the stress by 1.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:59
There's stress, you say?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:02
All strokes?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:07
Okay.

[GM] 22:41:08
Uh, so you get 10 hit points, and then… Um… If you… okay.

[GM] 22:41:15
This is your… first dose in… Um, last 24 hours, make a death save, so roll D… D10? Hold on one second.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:21
Oh.

[Ink] 22:41:28
Sorry.

[GM] 22:41:31
Figure out…

[GM] 22:41:36
I assume it's a D10.

[Ink] 22:41:37
Did I miss anything in the images that… any events that you'd want?

[Dex Miro] 22:41:46
The Spider thing, it's… I like that.

[Ink] 22:41:50
Don't turned out for a while.

[Dex Miro] 22:41:56
Well, seems pretty good.

[GM] 22:42:01
Okay. Okay, you rolled to 2. Alright.

[Ink] 22:42:03
I don't know what happened, I don't know if I got everything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:05
Yep.

[GM] 22:42:06
You're good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:09
Um, we were saying we're gonna go through and scavenge the, uh, bodies of the, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:16
troubleshooters.

[Ink] 22:42:18
Murderbot just heal up 10? Oh, nice. Nice roll. So you're back to full health, or what?

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:20
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:22
But it's… yeah, I went for… I had 7.

[Ink] 22:42:27
And what's your max health? Nice, nice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:29
15, so I wasted 2, but I'm at full health now.

[Ink] 22:42:34
Okay, why not? And so, the two is just to see if he overdoses or something, GM?

[GM] 22:42:39
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:45
So yeah, GM, whatever loot…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:47
on these guys, if we can…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:49
Find any clues to… as to what the hell's going on, if we can.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:54
whatever's on these…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:57
Bodies…

[GM] 22:42:59
Um, I mean, the bodies are completely severed, the armor's useless.

[GM] 22:43:05
Uh, as a result, um… They probably have… they all had… SMGs, as far as I know.

[GM] 22:43:15
Um, and so you could probably recover, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:15
Okay. This…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:18
ammo?

[GM] 22:43:22
to, uh, two clips.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:27
Well, whoever can actually shoot should take those, because I can't fucking shoot worth it.

[Ink] 22:43:27
Um, can we gather them?

[Ink] 22:43:31
We gather up the purple, uh… Gems?

[GM] 22:43:36
Uh… from their bodies, you mean?

[Ink] 22:43:40
Yeah, from the bodies from floating in the air, either one of them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:41
Ooh, that's a good one.

[GM] 22:43:45
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:46
But then, like, how did you do it? Like, do you do it with, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:48
Gloves on or something, because if… I'm guessing if I…

[Ink] 22:43:51
I mean, we can touch them, you can.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:53
Oh, that's right, yeah, yeah. So humans can touch them, yeah.

[Ink] 22:43:58
They seem to just bounce off us.

[GM] 22:44:01
Okay. Um… Alright, yeah, yeah, you can collect the gems if you want.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:02
Yeah, can you abstract off?

[Ink] 22:44:06
Yeah. Alright, no. Yeah, I'll collect them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:06
Ooh…

[GM] 22:44:07
Do you do that? Alright, make a sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:11
Whoa…

[Ink] 22:44:14
I got gloves on.

[GM] 22:44:17
That's not why.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:26
Like, everybody, or just ink?

[GM] 22:44:29
Uh, whoever's watching, do this. Uh… Um, take a point of stress… And then… make a panic check.

[Ink] 22:44:30
Critical failure, I go insane.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:32
Oh. My. God.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:39
Oh, no!

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:43
Oh, no!

[GM] 22:44:44
Which is roll a D20. Yeah. You gather up these body parts, and then you start prying out these, uh… There's… there's no difference between this body. It's not like the inside of… Uh, Murder bot. These look like human insides, and you start prying out these gems, and you start to feel like, what the am I doing?

[Dex Miro] 22:44:44
Hmm.

[Ink] 22:44:45
Roll D20.

[GM] 22:45:08
Uh… Let me roll one, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:13
Oh, no.

[GM] 22:45:15
And you're like, what the am I doing? Why aren't we killing that Spider guy? And you rush off to go kill that spider guy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:22
Oh, no!

[Ink] 22:45:22
I wasn't gonna do that anyway.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:45:23
Yeah…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:45:24
No.

[GM] 22:45:28
Um…

[GM] 22:45:31
Uh, reduce your stress by 1D5.

[Ink] 22:45:38
by 1 to 5.

[GM] 22:45:39
Yep. He just got an adrenaline rush off of this.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:40
Like, going insane fixes your stress. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:45
Oh…

[GM] 22:45:46
Um…

[Ink] 22:45:47
How much trash can you have?

[GM] 22:45:50
Uh, generally speaking, uh, I don't think there's a limit, but at some point you will just automatically start failing your panics.

[GM] 22:45:58
saves, and there's always a chance that you just instantly die in a panic save.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:02
Oh, Jesus.

[GM] 22:46:05
Um, alright, uh, let's see. No, go on, we're kind of… you guys just watch, uh, Inc, start praying these things out, and then it looks like he gets an idea in his head, and he just kicks off, and he goes. Uh, he starts floating down the hallway, turns the corner.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:07
Good to know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:08
GM, okay, so to get this…

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:11
Oh

[GM] 22:46:22
Um, before you guys can even see it. That's true, but you guys can't even get a word out to him before he takes off, um… Alright. You…

[Ink] 22:46:23
No, I passed my shotgun first and go, yee-haw, before I run off, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:33
The fuck?

[Dex Miro] 22:46:35
So he doesn't go like past the spikes, right? This is like a T-junction kind of thing, and the spider earth creature came from the side or something.

[GM] 22:46:41
Yeah, so he goes to the right, uh… Ink, it opens up into… And Area 60A.

[GM] 22:46:51
Right. Yeah, 60A. Uh… Hold on.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:54
Would…

[GM] 22:46:58
Alright, uh, in this room, there are massive cylinders, uh… walls are smeared with filth. Uh, there are steel guiding cables, uh, leading from one entrance to the other.

[GM] 22:47:12
And as you grab onto one of the steel cables, because you're like, surely this is how it's getting around, and you start pulling yourself.

[GM] 22:47:18
Um… You see large chunks of… looks like.

[GM] 22:47:24
maybe dried algae? uh, floating around in this space, and… this, uh… it smells awful in here.

[GM] 22:47:36
Uh, you start pulling yourself along the steel cable until you get to an intersection.

[GM] 22:47:41
Um, with… a bunch of other steel webs.

[GM] 22:47:46
Um… Uh, let's see…

[GM] 22:47:58
Roll a 1D2.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:02
Just Ink?

[GM] 22:48:03
Just Ink. Okay. You… you were like, I think probably it would have got… tried to get away from us the furthest away it could have.

[GM] 22:48:13
You start traversing using, uh, steel cabling that. goes the furthest away from where you're currently at. Um… you get to a door, uh…

[Ink] 22:48:29
It's shut.

[GM] 22:48:30
What's that? Is it shut? Yeah. Um, it's, uh… Actually, it's not shut, it's open.

[GM] 22:48:39
Um, inside the room… So this is, like, it takes you a while to traverse this room, like, 30 minutes to do this.

[GM] 22:48:48
Um, inside the room, uh, is a complex fractal patterns of steel webbing forming tunnels and moving towards a central chamber.

[GM] 22:48:57
Um… Uh… So… You see all sorts of bodies floating around in here.

[GM] 22:49:08
Um, some of them, like, enrapped with, uh… are held in place with steel webbing.

[GM] 22:49:16
Um… At the center of the… this now kind of, like, forms into, like, a web that's sort of, like, more commonplace that you.

[GM] 22:49:25
can imagine, like, a spider making. At the center of it, you see the hunter.

[GM] 22:49:30
Uh, and then it sees you. Um… you go first.

[Ink] 22:49:37
But at this point, I'm pretty much driven to attack it, right?

[GM] 22:49:40
I mean, you know, you could change your mind now that you've.

[GM] 22:49:44
You've, like, um… your adrenaline's a bit worn off.

[Ink] 22:49:47
Okay.

[GM] 22:49:48
The adrenaline brush only lasts for, like, 2 to 10 minutes, and it's been, like, 30 minutes, so…

[Ink] 22:49:56
Okay. Sorry, yeah, sorry, it was… seemed like a really good idea.

[Ink] 22:50:02
And then I'm kind of exhausted, and now coming to my senses.

[GM] 22:50:06
Uh-huh. Actually, first, real quick, uh, let me check in with the rest of the team.

[Ink] 22:50:10
Okay.

[GM] 22:50:11
You guys see… see, uh… ink do this? What do you do?

[Dex Miro] 22:50:23
Oh.

[Ink] 22:50:24
Uh, nice. And only Dex has any chance of keeping up with me, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:27
what to do…

[GM] 22:50:33
Um, yeah, pretty likely. Um, I mean, someone might get… inventive about how they might traverse this, but.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:41
Why is this the only one that can keep up?

[GM] 22:50:44
Because it's all in 0G right now.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:46
0G training. Right, so is my pulse rifle that I tossed down the hallway?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:46
Oh, oh, that's right, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:53
Am I able to retrieve that, or is that just gone?

[GM] 22:50:56
It's destroyed.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:57
Okay. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:01
Take my pulse rifle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:03
I have an SMG.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:07
And go after him, Dex!

[Dex Miro] 22:51:12
Who was there? So far, there's… like, we can just pull on the cable.

[GM] 22:51:18
What do you mean?

[Dex Miro] 22:51:20
Like, is… did it, like, leave the cable behind it, or did it, like, shoot it somewhere and then… pulling it to get out of the room so there's no cable in here.

[GM] 22:51:29
There's no cable in here.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:30
Okay. Alright, so nobody else could just use that to pull themselves along, because the… Like, that would be more of just, like, a pure strength thing, which I think Carnoc would be good at, so…

[GM] 22:51:35
No.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:41
Alright, um… I don't know, I mean, I'm at least gonna go up to that door that Ink disappeared out of and look at it.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:51
And… shout at him as he's leaving. Ink, what are you doing? Come back.

[GM] 22:51:53
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:56
But he obviously doesn't listen, because we've already done that.

[GM] 22:51:59
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:59
So…

[Dex Miro] 22:52:03
But what would I… So there wasn't a cable in that room or anything either, like, he was just… Like, working on his own bouncing off the walls to get through the room.

[GM] 22:52:14
Yeah, I mean, he… Use the most efficient form of travel for himself, which was just, like, you know, using the handholds on the walls, and then… you saw him, like, when you turned the corner because you went after him.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:23
Yeah.

[GM] 22:52:28
Um, you see him, like, grab onto the wires that are in the next room and, like, start traversing using those.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:34
Okay. How far away do the wires start?

[GM] 22:52:39
Oh, they're almost immediately in the next room, like… Once you cross the threshold into that room, then there's wires around.

[GM] 22:52:53
Oh, you're gonna continue to pursue them?

[Dex Miro] 22:52:57
Well, Teamsters, don't leave a man behind, do they? Or is that just Marines?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:53:02
Your symptoms. I mean, it probably gonna pursue, I'll pursue as well.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:06
I mean… Could I help Karnak get to someplace where he has a handhold?

[GM] 22:53:08
Okay. Uh, if…

[GM] 22:53:14
Yeah, you can easily do that. You just kind of push them towards the wall.

[GM] 22:53:19
Um… Uh, Karnak, if you're gonna do that, if you want to try and keep up with Zeke, you're gonna have to make a speed check.

[Ink] 22:53:27
Dex.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:28
In context, you do. Yeah.

[GM] 22:53:28
Oh, sorry, not… yeah, sorry, uh, Karnak's gonna have to meet, yeah, with Dex.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:53:33
Um, it looks great, too.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:37
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:53:39
Oh.

[GM] 22:53:41
Yep, alright, you keep up with them. Uh, Murderbot and Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 22:53:49
Um…

[Ink] 22:53:56
I should yelled. I'm off to see you meantime.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:03
Um… I guess follow them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:06
I mean, as fast as we can, possibly, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:10
you know.

[GM] 22:54:11
Yeah, mega text check.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:18
Dex?

[GM] 22:54:20
Oh, sorry, speed, speed, speed, sorry.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:21
No, no, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:22
Oh, speed.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:26
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:27
Fuck me!

[GM] 22:54:28
Okay, uh, you took a point of stress, um… You get tangled up with, uh, with Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:32
What the fuck?

[GM] 22:54:37
uh, he didn't want to go anyways. Um, okay. Uh, you're left behind.

[GM] 22:54:45
Alright, um… Right. Coming back to, uh, the encounter between Inc. And… the hunter… I think you get to go first.

[Ink] 22:55:00
Alright, so we locked eyes.

[GM] 22:55:02
Uh-huh.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:04
But it has more eyes than you, so it wins.

[Ink] 22:55:06
That's true. It saw me move and everything like that, so playing dead probably is not gonna.

[Ink] 22:55:17
Too much. And I just… I just came through a door.

[GM] 22:55:18
Yeah.

[GM] 22:55:24
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:55:31
Um, do I think that I can swing out that door before I could shoot a web, or something like that?

[GM] 22:55:38
Yeah, I mean, you're… you're… you could, you know, position yourself outside the door. I mean, you can… if you want to shoot at it first, you can do that as well.

[Ink] 22:55:46
No, I don't… I'm not gonna shoot at it, I'm going to try to retreat.

[GM] 22:55:51
Okay. Alright, um… you try to pull yourself back along the… Um, metal cabling, um, and particularly trying to get yourself out of line of sight of the doorway.

[GM] 22:56:06
Um…

[GM] 22:56:13
Okay. Uh, it goes… you see it sort of crawl to the door, and from there, it launches.

[GM] 22:56:23
Um, although it seems wounded enough that. Um… its aim isn't too good.

[GM] 22:56:31
Uh, but it launches a web attribute to try and entangle you.

[GM] 22:56:38
Um…

[Ink] 22:56:41
Yes.

[GM] 22:56:46
Okay. The steel web wraps around you. Um, make a body save.

[Ink] 22:56:55
bodies.

[Ink] 22:57:01
Hmm.

[GM] 22:57:03
Okay. You are entangled by it. Uh, and take… Uh, 2 damage.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:04
Oh my god.

[GM] 22:57:12
is the, um… It's like… coarse metal wire wraps around your skin.

[GM] 22:57:19
It's essentially, like, a really bad… rug burn slash, uh, you might get a few metal splinters.

[Ink] 22:57:19
Okay.

[GM] 22:57:29
Okay, uh, at this point, Karnak and, uh, Dex, uh… Come up, you see… uh, ink entangled by this, uh, by the creature, um, and… Uh, it's in this sort of doorway area.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:46
How far apart are the two of them right now?

[GM] 22:57:49
Uh, not very far, like… Like, they're in close range of each other.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:54
Okay.

[GM] 22:57:55
Not in Melee, perhaps. They're not adjacent to one another, but… They're close.

[GM] 22:58:00
You guys are also considered close at this point.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:58:09
Alright, I'll take a shot at the creature.

[GM] 22:58:13
Okay.

[GM] 22:58:21
Okay. Uh, roll your… Damage. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:23
Um…

[GM] 22:58:28
Your gun jams again. What the… what the with this SMG?

[Dex Miro] 22:58:29
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:29
Oh my god!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:58:30
Oh no. Someone give you a different weapon.

[Ink] 22:58:34
Um… yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:58:36
One's defensive.

[GM] 22:58:37
Alright, Dex.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:37
I… I mean…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:42
I don't even have another weapon, unless I actually did take Murderbot SMG. Is that something that happened, or something we just talked about?

[GM] 22:58:49
Yeah, you could… well, you didn't have to take Murderbot's, since you guys collected…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:52
Oh, that's right, we collected the… troubleshooter, that's okay.

[GM] 22:58:55
Yeah, I mean, you have an SMG and maybe two clips for an SMG, since you have pulse rifle ammo before.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:00
Yeah.

[GM] 22:59:03
Um…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:59:04
Your symptoms.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:09
Okay, um… I don't know, what else do I got here?

[Dex Miro] 22:59:21
I don't know what one of my slick squares does.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:26
Alright, um… I don't want to shoot at it, because they're too close together.

[GM] 22:59:32
Well, they're not… they're not totally in line with one another.

[GM] 22:59:36
Uh, because of the way that… Inc. Was trying to get out of line of sight. He's kind of off at an angle, whereas your approach is more straight on.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:43
Okay. Well, I didn't really get a sense of, like, how… Is ink, like, incapacitated? Like, he's gonna have to spend a while untangling himself here, or…

[GM] 22:59:55
He is… probably not going to be able to move himself. Could he do other things? Probably.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:01
Okay.

[GM] 23:00:06
is effectively attached to the… The Hunter.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:06
Alright, okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:11
Okay, I got you now. Alright, um, I guess I'll shoot at it with my SMG, although I don't even have an SMG, so I don't know what to roll.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:21
So, I could just do combat for starters, but…

[GM] 23:00:22
You roll a combat check. Yeah.

[GM] 23:00:26
Okay, you hit, and you do 2D10.

[GM] 23:00:35
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:35
Not great.

[GM] 23:00:42
Okay, um…

[Ink] 23:00:48
Am I hearing again?

[GM] 23:00:49
It. Uh…

[Dex Miro] 23:00:52
The creature gets to go first, right? Or no? Sorry.

[Ink] 23:00:55
I went, then the spider went, and then those two went.

[GM] 23:00:57
Yeah, you guys have been acting before it, so… It lashed out, yeah, so you get to go.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:00
Okay.

[Ink] 23:01:06
I'm gonna use my Espernetic Feedback Loop on it.

[GM] 23:01:09
Okay.

[Ink] 23:01:12
Um, I'm going to make a sanity save with Advantage.

[GM] 23:01:15
Yep.

[GM] 23:01:26
Alright. Yep.

[Ink] 23:01:26
So I'll do is take 1D damage and distress.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:27
Oh, dear. So that… that means it just doesn't do anything?

[Ink] 23:01:30
At least I didn't critically fail. Yep. It fails.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:33
Alright.

[GM] 23:01:34
Yep. Um, alright.

[GM] 23:01:39
you focus real hard. Smoke comes out of your ears.

[Ink] 23:01:42
Yeah.

[GM] 23:01:45
Um, the creature reels you in, uh, and then retreats back into the… the room with you.

[GM] 23:01:54
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:02:03
Look at Ken Cardack and I still see him?

[GM] 23:02:05
You have to get up to the doorway.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:09
Okay, I understand what's going on now, okay.

[GM] 23:02:15
Um… Which you can do on your turn.

[GM] 23:02:24
Do you want to get up to the doorway?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:02:29
Yeah, sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:34
Do we have any other weapons besides… Texas, SMG, IncarnoxMG.

[GM] 23:02:43
Um…

[GM] 23:02:48
Do you have any other weapons besides those? I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:52
Okay, well, I guess I'm saying I don't have any other weapons, does Carnoc have any weapons besides the German SMG?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:02:57
I have a hunter shot, I forget exactly what that does.

[GM] 23:03:06
I don't know what it does.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:11
Just a moment…

[Dex Miro] 23:03:28
So that is… wait, which thing is… Facebook.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:03:39
Let's till you turn the image.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:49
Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:04:06
Oh my gosh. Well, we should go up to the door, I guess, and see what we see, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:04:16
So it's, like, the creature's just, like, yanking on the web to pull link towards it.

[GM] 23:04:23
Uh, Ink was reeled in. Because he was entangled. And then it retreated into the doorway out of sight of you.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:25
Yeah, okay. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:33
Alright, then yeah, I'll… go look and see if… is it reasonable for us to shoot again, or are we just gonna hit if we shoot?

[GM] 23:04:40
You can move and shoot, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:44
So it's not quite like…

[GM] 23:04:45
You can't see. You can't see either of them right now. I need you to say whether you're moving up to the door.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:49
Okay, yes, let us move to the door, yes.

[GM] 23:04:51
Okay, you both move up to the door. Uh, you see Ink completely enwrapped.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:04:52
Yes.

[GM] 23:04:57
Except for, like, maybe his eyes. Uh, and he kind of looks above the door, and as you look up, two blades come… slinging down at you.

[Ink] 23:05:00
Uh-huh.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:07
What?

[Ink] 23:05:08
Oh. waiting for him?

[GM] 23:05:12
Yeah. It ain't no dummy, it's not… it's not a dumb spider. It's set a trap, that's what these things do.

[Ink] 23:05:16
Oh.

[GM] 23:05:24
Um… alright. Uh… And… and… let's see… Dex is the first one.

[GM] 23:05:33
Um, okay, hits Karnak. You take…

[GM] 23:05:45
25.

[Ink] 23:05:48
Oh.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:48
What? That seems like a high number.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:05:52
Yeah, that's more than I have.

[GM] 23:05:55
How many wounds do you have?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:05:58
Uh… I don't think I have any wounds.

[GM] 23:06:03
Probably not.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:04
We've done tracking that on Resolve.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:06:07
Yeah, I don't have any words.

[GM] 23:06:10
Okay. So, however many hit points, and then it carries over, and so you can get multiple wounds, because I think Marines have up to 3 wounds.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:11
Lucky you, I wouldn't.

[GM] 23:06:21
If I'm not mistaken.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:06:24
Will I'm at one, but… You know, yeah, I mean, one after it carries over once.

[GM] 23:06:28
Okay. Okay, so you take one wound.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:32
Right. And I actually should have used a stimpack, and I don't limit there.

[GM] 23:06:42
Alright, here's my one, too. This would be… bleeding, I guess?

[Dex Miro] 23:06:43
Or… or an auto med, he's carrying both things.

[GM] 23:06:54
It's not blunt force, not gunshot, fire, explosive, core, massive. No, I think it's… it's bleeding.

[GM] 23:06:59
Okay. Slices for…

[GM] 23:07:07
5. 5 is… Oh, Jesus. Uh…

[GM] 23:07:19
Let's say you guys, like… in your reaction.

[GM] 23:07:24
You're gonna lose fingers or toes. What do you want to lose?

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:27
Oh my god!

[Dex Miro] 23:07:29
What, both of us, or just Carnoc?

[GM] 23:07:30
No, just Carnoc's the other one… the other tech missed.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:07:34
I guess, uh…

[Ink] 23:07:37
Toes grow back, fingers don't.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:39
You're gonna… you can't shoot a gun with toes!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:07:41
Yeah, just lose toes.

[GM] 23:07:43
Alright, well, let's say you, like, kicked off, and you're, like, you were looking up, and it sliced, uh, cut off the front of your boot.

[GM] 23:07:49
Uh… To the front of your boot goes, uh, you lose 3 toes, and you start bleeding profusely from the hole.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:55
I would double-check the number of toes Carnoc was probably wearing steel-toe boots.

[GM] 23:08:01
I mean, then it's fingers if it's… that's the case.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:08:10
How do I stop the bleeding?

[GM] 23:08:13
Uh, a stimpack probably would do it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:08:16
It's good. We'll use the stimpack, then.

[GM] 23:08:21
Alright, um… You guys can shoot.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:08:25
Do I have to roll something to them? Yeah, I'd be told.

[GM] 23:08:27
Post impact? You roll a D10 for how many hit points you heal?

[GM] 23:08:44
Does the stimpack stop bleeding?

[GM] 23:08:49
Okay. Yeah. I'll say that stimpacks stem the bleeding.

[GM] 23:08:57
If you jam it in the hole.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:09:00
Okay.

[GM] 23:09:02
Alright, um, and then make a death save. Roller 1D10.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:09:07
It would be perfect.

[GM] 23:09:11
Yeah. He's not unconscious, it's just… it's a part of the stimpack rules.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:11
the two…

[GM] 23:09:19
Alright, um, yeah, now you guys can act. Throughout your turn, was your intent was to go up and shoot it?

[GM] 23:09:26
But now your action… sorry, Carnoc's action was to… To stem his bleeding.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:09:28
Let me tell you with my actions.

[GM] 23:09:34
Uh, so, Dex…

[Dex Miro] 23:09:39
I guess I can try to shoot it with an SMG again.

[GM] 23:09:42
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:43
Probability is not in my favor on this one.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:47
Wait, so can I… Since I was apparently a complete dumbass and did not use my stimpack any time in the last 20 minutes.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:55
I should probably use one now.

[GM] 23:09:59
Um… you feel like that maybe that giant thing that is within… adjacent to you with scything blades is probably not going to care how many stimpacks you take.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:08
Uh, this is fair. Alright. That's accurate.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:13
So, like, how close am I to it?

[GM] 23:10:17
Um… it's adjacent to. Like, it nearly hits you with, uh, it's metal… Scythe.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:25
Alright. Can I try to, like, jam my Vibechete, or however you pronounce that, in his mouth?

[GM] 23:10:32
Sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:34
I don't care if I lose it.

[GM] 23:10:38
Alright, let's make a strength check, then. I should think so, you're… you said you're just trying to jam it as hard as you can into it, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:41
Strength instead of combat. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:48
Yeah, okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:53
Failure.

[GM] 23:10:55
Um, okay. Um… do your damage?

[GM] 23:11:05
19…

[GM] 23:11:10
Okay, um… You stab it, uh… into, like, trying to, like… cut through its, like, scything… it, like, puts up a scything blade in response, and, like, you cut through that into its torso, but…

[GM] 23:11:25
Uh, in the process, your Vibechete is destroyed.

[GM] 23:11:28
But it is also dead.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:31
Oh.

[Ink] 23:11:31
Oh my gosh. Nice.

[Ink] 23:11:37
What's a Vibechete?

[Dex Miro] 23:11:38
I don't know, a machete that vibrates, is all I could figure out. I didn't have a description, it just sounded like a blade.

[Ink] 23:11:46
I find interesting things on Google when I search for that.

[Ink] 23:11:52
Oh, wait, actually, this one says Mothership Vibechete.

[Ink] 23:11:56
It's a gun?

[Dex Miro] 23:11:58
No, it's a web… it's a blade, isn't it?

[GM] 23:11:59
That's definitely… it's definitely, uh… you have to be adjacent, uh, it cuts through all armor.

[GM] 23:12:05
Um, which, to me, implies that it has some sort of… it's not just a machete, it's gotta have some sort of, like… either mechanical component to it, or some sort of, like, energy component to it.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:15
I didn't really understand what it was, but it seemed like a good stab weapon.

[Ink] 23:12:16
Where are you heading? Where did you get that from?

[Dex Miro] 23:12:20
I've had it, like, the whole time we've been playing this game, and I never used it.

[Ink] 23:12:24
I mean, this is time to bring it out.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:27
Yeah.

[GM] 23:12:28
Um… okay. Uh, it is clearly dead.

[GM] 23:12:34
Um… Yeah. Even if you could get it out, it would… your Vibe shutting is no longer functioning.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:35
So it's just, like, permanently lodged in it. Yeah.

[GM] 23:12:44
You could use it as, like, a piece of metal to pry things open with, I guess.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:47
No, I've already got a spanner.

[GM] 23:12:49
Yeah.

[GM] 23:12:53
Um, let's see, there might be a few other things in this room.

[GM] 23:12:57
So… 60… B? Complex fractal patterns of steel webbing form tunnels in the central chamber.

[GM] 23:13:07
Uh, filled with puncture, wound ridden. Androids… Oh, okay.

[GM] 23:13:15
At the center… oh, yeah, I guess you can kind of see it, because now that the creature's moved out of the way, you can kind of see deep into the thing.

[GM] 23:13:23
You see…

[Dex Miro] 23:13:26
We have to help Ink out of the webbing, or is he able to get out?

[GM] 23:13:32
Uh, you have to help him out.

[Ink] 23:13:36
Silver Lance? That sounds like something that would replace his vibechete?

[GM] 23:13:40
Okay, you see at the center of it a silver lance braided copper cables.

[GM] 23:13:51
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:57
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

[GM] 23:13:57
I think… I think it's a Silver… Silver Lance.

[GM] 23:14:01
It has braided copper cables maybe off the back of it?

[GM] 23:14:05
I have no idea.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:07
But, like, is it supposed to be a weapon sort of thing?

[GM] 23:14:12
I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:16
Alright. Alright. Well, can we take a closer look at it?

[GM] 23:14:17
You don't know. You go over it. It looks… it looks cool.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:23
It's like, Carnoc, do you think you can stab people with this?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:14:26
I don't know. Does it look like a weapon?

[GM] 23:14:32
It says the Silver Lance, so it looks like an old-timey, uh, thing that you might… While riding a horse, you might leverage against the other knight.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:44
Zero G jousting.

[Ink] 23:14:49
Ride on the spider's back, and, you know.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:52
Oh, dear.

[GM] 23:14:59
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:01
Alright, like, is it attached to things, or…

[GM] 23:15:08
It's not attached to anything.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:10
Alright, well, should we take it with us, or do we think it's bad?

[Ink] 23:15:16
It must be awesome. Grab it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:15:18
Yeah, let's take it.

[Ink] 23:15:20
I mean, he lost toes over it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:15:23
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:26
Like, I just don't have a picture of, like, how big is this thing, like, can we reasonably take it with us, or is it, like, 10 feet long and just…

[GM] 23:15:31
It is… It's reasonable to take with.

[GM] 23:15:36
But it is not something… I would say it's… it's as large as a pulse rifle, let's say.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:44
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:51
Maybe this is another artifact that we shouldn't take down that hallway, I don't know.

[GM] 23:15:56
Uh, speaking of back in the hallway… Um… What is, uh, Zeke and Murderbot been up to after they.

[GM] 23:16:06
failed to keep up.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:10
What have we been doing?

[Dex Miro] 23:16:14
I don't know, didn't Nariko freak out?

[GM] 23:16:18
Uh, she seems fine. She said, boy, that thing really killed a bunch of people.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:26
Um, when…

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:28
When, um, Inc.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:31
Did ink takes the thing he fished out of the bodies?

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:36
Or did he just, like…

[Ink] 23:16:38
I got a pot full of purple crystals, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:38
As he was fishing out, he had a mental break.

[GM] 23:16:41
He's probably gonna… he's probably, like, got 2. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:42
And the…

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:44
She's got 2 crystals.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:49
Hmm…

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:51
I wonder if Zeke… no, I wouldn't suggest Zeke fish them out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:55
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:01
I mean, I guess we continue to go try and go down the path.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:08
That we think when they went down as well.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:12
Um…

[GM] 23:17:13
Is that what, uh, Zeke would do?

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:15
I don't know what Zeke is… what is Zeke thinking?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:17:18
I mean, I guess we were trying, so…

[GM] 23:17:22
Alright, so you guys more slowly come up. So, by the time you get up there, um… But the rest of the crew, you guys are… Uh, the battle's already over, and you see… Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:26
Yeah.

[GM] 23:17:35
Uh, decks slowly unwrapping, um… ink, and, uh, Carnoc has a silver lance he's holding onto.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:45
Whoa, what is that?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:17:48
I don't know. Is this what they chopped off my toes with?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:17:54
Or was it just his cause?

[GM] 23:17:55
Just as his scything blade, no, it's not the same.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:18:00
I don't know, we found it down there in the room with the spider monster.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:04
Pretty cool.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:18:11
We can… we can joust with it, we can, like, push off and… Zero V and fly down the corridor.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:15
Just.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:20
could use as a paddle.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:23
To float down faster.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:26
Is there anything we can harvest from the creature that would be of any help? Maybe Zeke could have a look at that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:33
Well, you guys killed the thing.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:18:35
Good idea.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:18:41
Sure.

[GM] 23:18:41
Zeke, are you gonna study it? Alright, um… You… you… science montage. You're like…

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:45
Zeke goes crazy.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:52
Modaj!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:18:53
best kind of montage.

[GM] 23:18:55
Um… After the montage is over, uh… You, you essentially learn that.

[GM] 23:19:04
Um… the majority of this creature is composed of different.

[GM] 23:19:09
Uh, human body parts, which are not actually human, um… Clearly, they've been manufactured.

[GM] 23:19:16
Uh, but they've all been manufactured out of the sort of same substance and material.

[GM] 23:19:21
Um… so… this thing has been assembled.

[GM] 23:19:26
Um… to look like this, and to act like this, this is sort of, uh… You think there's some intentionality behind its design? Um… And that this was not, uh… Probably not some, like.

[GM] 23:19:43
rogue intelligence that assembled itself like this, like, you know, there's.

[GM] 23:19:46
some sort of… like, clearly the design of it is intentional, um…

[GM] 23:19:55
It is… you determine mostly Android parts, um… Beyond that, the steel webbing is a really intricate, um… internal, um, mechanical device, um… tied in and controlled by, like, the neurological material that most androids have running through them.

[GM] 23:20:16
Um… it's a nifty design, but, uh, not… not too much, uh… Nothing, like, uniquely special about, like, the materials that were used, or the… Um, for lack of a better term, the physiology of the creature.

[Dex Miro] 23:20:37
So it's an Android spider creature built by Androids.

[GM] 23:20:42
Yeah, seems likely.

[Dex Miro] 23:20:53
Can you, like, download the Android's memories or anything? Like… Murder, but can you try to merge your consciousness with it somehow? Is that a thing?

[GM] 23:20:53
So you guys are… oh, go ahead.

[GM] 23:21:03
Um, you recall that, um… what's-his-face back on the bell, uh, said he would pay.

[GM] 23:21:11
For, um, intelligence cores, or whatever they're called. From androids.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:17
Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't a lot, though, but…

[Ink] 23:21:20
Oh, so we should go collect all their intelligence cores.

[Ink] 23:21:24
Now, did I go crazy because I was touching the purple crystals or because of all the blood and stuff?

[GM] 23:21:29
All the blood and stuff.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:31
Yeah. You were, like, handling pieces of what's essentially humans, and… No.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:39
So I'm assuming we can't, like. Stick one of the purple crystals to it after it's dead, and then… So you murderbot can read its memories.

[GM] 23:21:49
Uh, you can stick a purple crystal to it. It does fuse with the… Uh, what the commonplace term is pseudo-flush.

[GM] 23:21:56
Um, it's not actual flush. Um, so the Purple Crystal will… fuse with it, but there's no, like, linking.

[GM] 23:22:06
Like, Murderbot doesn't sense any consciousness, he can't… like, dive into it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:11
Oh…

[Dex Miro] 23:22:14
And the crystals permanently stuck to it now. Oh, okay.

[GM] 23:22:16
Not permanently, you could pry it out.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:22
Alright, then I think we should take the crystal with us.

[Ink] 23:22:28
Let me get the memory core?

[GM] 23:22:29
Yeah, you can get the core.

[Ink] 23:22:32
From the spider?

[GM] 23:22:38
Logic course, that's what they're called.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:43
Okay, so we removed to Logic Core to take back to Arcadia.

[GM] 23:22:53
Alright, you're in 60B.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:57
Does anybody think of anything else we can learn from this?

[Dex Miro] 23:22:59
Horrifying thing.

[Ink] 23:23:26
that worked out well.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:27
I thought we were all gonna die.

[GM] 23:23:32
That worked out well. It's missing 3 toes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:36
Yeah, we need to figure out how to fix the toes.

[Ink] 23:23:39
He had… he had 6 to start with. You know, he's a mutant.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:44
What?

[Ink] 23:23:48
So…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:23:49
Exactly.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:08
So, as you said, we are now 60A. B.

[GM] 23:24:12
B.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:14
Or 60p.

[GM] 23:24:19
Next to 60A.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:20
Oh, it is. I don't know why I was so excited. I was looking for other white rooms, apparently.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:28
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:34
Where we've been trying to go, I don't even remember.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:36
Yeah, we got pulled out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:38
of where we were.

[Ink] 23:24:43
Where are we now, GM? Sorry, I missed that.

[GM] 23:24:45
6 dB.

[Ink] 23:24:47
60B… Oh, we went back that way. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:54
What was the hallway again?

[GM] 23:24:57
four-way intersection at 59B.

[Ink] 23:25:01
We're essentially making our way towards 57A. Right?

[Dex Miro] 23:25:05
So 59B was that you can't take it with you, Holly?

[Dex Miro] 23:25:08
Okay.

[GM] 23:25:08
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:16
Okay, so did we… before we went from, like, 60D to 59D to 59B to 60A, or is that… Or 60 A and D connected to each other.

[GM] 23:25:29
Uh, 60A and D are not connected. You went 59B to 60A to 60B.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:35
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:41
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:46
So what do we do now?

[Dex Miro] 23:25:52
Alright, well, first, I'm gonna use a stent pack.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:00
Let's… let's all come to the conclusion of…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:26:03
I'll on you have my gun.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:05
what are we… so we don't tell anybody that we are androids.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:10
First off…

[Dex Miro] 23:26:13
That was a terrible stimpact.

[GM] 23:26:15
By the way, uh, Karnak, when you take a stim pack, you're supposed to reduce one's stress as well, if you didn't do that.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:26:20
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:24
Oh, do I also reduce the stress? Okay. Do I only have… like, if I have the Stimpak item that's single use, and now it's gone?

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:26
Yes.

[GM] 23:26:27
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:32
Yes.

[GM] 23:26:33
Yes. Uh, roll a death save, Dex.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:34
Okay, then I'll delete that, too.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:40
Uh, how do I do that?

[GM] 23:26:42
1 to 20. No, sorry, 1 to 10, if you guys, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:42
1D to… 1D20?

[Dex Miro] 23:26:46
Oh, maybe I should…

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:46
1D…

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:47
Listen to what GM said first, before…

[Dex Miro] 23:26:52
Maybe I should have used an Automat instead of a sympack.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:52
Who would say to me.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:58
It's an automated more for healing when you're not in a stress situation.

[GM] 23:27:02
Uh, nanotech pills that assist your body in repairing damage by granting to body saves meant to repel disease and poison, as well as attempt to heal from rest.

[GM] 23:27:10
So it doesn't instantly heal you like a StemPak does.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:13
Right, but we're not in immediate danger anymore, so it doesn't… I already deleted my… I already deleted my Stempad, because I'm an idiot, so I'm going to use one of my four auto mods instead.

[Murderbot V2] 23:27:16
For now…

[GM] 23:27:17
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:24
Um, I'll just… I don't know, I'm looking at you just… Correct.

[GM] 23:27:27
Wait, you're not… you're not… you're not using the system pack?

[GM] 23:27:32
Okay. You can add it back to your sheet.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:36
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just gonna…

[GM] 23:27:36
I don't care about that.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:41
And that was a small item, right? I think it was one.

[GM] 23:27:43
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:47
Yeah, that just seems like… And all of that is the right item to use when you're not in a stress situation.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:54
Alright, so what do I do for automatic again? I'm sorry.

[GM] 23:27:58
Uh, nothing, it just… It grants you advantage on healing from rusting, I think.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:58
Nothing. It just, like, slowly…

[Dex Miro] 23:28:04
Oh, okay, so it doesn't actually do anything.

[GM] 23:28:10
Yeah, it's not… yeah, it's not… Stimpaks are very much like, if you want need healing right now, you use that.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:16
Okay, then I'm back to the stem pack, I'm sorry for the flip fly.

[GM] 23:28:19
That's right, keep your 3.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:21
Okay. Alright, it's impact deleted.

[GM] 23:28:27
Uh, roll death save. B10.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:29
And that was a D10 or D20.

[GM] 23:28:34
Okay. No.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:37
Is that bad? What does it do?

[GM] 23:28:41
Sorry.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:43
Alright, so I reduced stress by 1, I gain 3 health. Okay, I'm done, sorry.

[Ink] 23:28:56
Thank you, Dex, for saving me with your Vib Shetty.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:05
It was so close, I just… Connected and stabbed it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:29:09
Yeah, that was pretty… ridiculous.

[Ink] 23:29:09
That was pretty sweet.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:28
Are there any other doors in this room besides the one we came in through?

[GM] 23:29:32
Yeah. Isn't that clear on the map?

[Dex Miro] 23:29:36
Um, I suppose so.

[GM] 23:29:38
Sorry, I'm not trying to be snarky, I just… I'm half looking at my book slash half looking at yours, so… I'm not really tracking.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:44
Yeah. I mean, is it, like… is this room, like… terrifying due to all the bodies, or is it…

[GM] 23:29:53
I mean, these… These are clearly androids.

[GM] 23:29:57
Um… like, which makes it slightly less horrifying for you, maybe a little bit more horrifying for Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:58
Yeah.

[GM] 23:30:05
Um… Seeing all his brethren wrapped up and… Ripped apart. Um… Yeah, but otherwise, uh… other than the stench that.

[GM] 23:30:18
Comes in from the other room. There's… there's nothing like… Like, scent-wise, that's, like, off-putting or anything.

[GM] 23:30:26
Um… you know, it feels like this is very much the layer of this… the Hunter.

[GM] 23:30:32
Um, and so… You know, some things like… Yeah, it is disturbing, but now… knowing that the hunter is dead is, you know, makes it so it's like, okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:45
I mean, are these just… are they, like, spare parts that are around, or are these other victims of the hunter? It seems like other victims?

[GM] 23:30:53
Yes, there are definitely other victims, um… They have… inspecting them shows that they have puncture wounds on their bodies, um.

[GM] 23:31:03
And so, like, the white fluid that typically is in androids, uh, seems to be.

[GM] 23:31:10
have been sucked out. Kind of like… What's that? Are there logic cores are still intact? Yes.

[Ink] 23:31:12
Are the memory cores still intact?

[Ink] 23:31:18
And we start taking all the logic cores? Well, I get freaked out again?

[GM] 23:31:19
Sure. No, this is, you know, this is not a human body. This is like… It's where it's like working on a machine.

[GM] 23:31:30
The other one was like, you know. clearly is bones and muscles were sticking out, and you're like, eh, I'm just gonna dig around in that.

[Ink] 23:31:32
Yeah.

[GM] 23:31:40
Um, there are…

[GM] 23:31:49
11Logic course.

[Ink] 23:31:52
Rich. So I have 12 logic cores now.

[GM] 23:31:57
Sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:10
Does anybody remember what we were trying to get to?

[Ink] 23:32:13
We are, um, trying to put, uh. bombs or radios or something in a couple different places.

[Ink] 23:32:22
Um… let me go back and look at my notes.

[Ink] 23:32:26
I think, um, so ultimately. I think we need to do it in 4… to… 4, 2, and 3, I think is where they're supposed to go.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:37
2… 2 Eden, 3.1, mainnet zone for human emulation labs, and 6 supported engineering.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:47
Well, like, we had a… we were clearly trying to go for one thing first, and I don't remember what that first thing was.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:55
Because that's why we picked this hatch to start with.

[Ink] 23:33:00
This was the best way to get in. Here's why we came.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:03
Arcadia did tell us where we should start, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:15
So, how do we get to…

[Ink] 23:33:18
So we need to make our way to 57A so that we can go up to Floor 4, and I believe we wanted to drop something off of Floor 4.

[Ink] 23:33:26
If I can find my notes…

[Dex Miro] 23:33:28
But one of the…

[GM] 23:33:29
Uh, her mission was install encrypted radio transmitters on floors 2, 3.1, 4, and 6.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:35
We're on 6 right now. But would… is there, like, a particular place, or it's just, like, anywhere on this floor?

[GM] 23:33:37
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:33:37
Oh, so we should just… we should install one of their encrypted radio transmitter.

[GM] 23:33:44
I think it's anywhere on the floor.

[Ink] 23:33:47
Oh, shoot, we should have done it at the door, shouldn't we have.

[GM] 23:33:52
Now they're thinking.

[Ink] 23:33:56
How do we miss that?

[GM] 23:33:59
Because you guys are thinking you're adventurers, just go exploring. And now Karnak's lost some toes, maybe.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:06
Nooooo!

[GM] 23:34:08
Don't worry, they're still floating around, they're right there.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:12
Ah. Sorry, where is 3.1?

[Ink] 23:34:20
3.1 is the maintenance floor zone, you see that… so if you go to about the center, move straight up.

[Ink] 23:34:26
you're gonna go through a maintenance zone hatch to 3.1.

[Ink] 23:34:30
Off of… off of Floor 2. Yeah, but that's where we'll get also, um, evacced from, so that's the last place, but that's the only way to get there is through.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:30
Okay, I got it. But, like, getting there is a nightmare.

[Ink] 23:34:40
is through, um, Eden.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:40
Right.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:43
Okay, we also have to go to Eden.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:49
So that's… we don't need to do one… we do need to do four.

[Ink] 23:34:54
You have to go through one, though, to get to two.

[Ink] 23:34:57
from 4.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:01
Okay, so we're pretty much planning on heading from 6… through floor 4… Through… You didn't.

[Ink] 23:35:10
Yeah, 6 to 4, drop something off at 4.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:13
To the maintenance zone, and then hopefully get out.

[Ink] 23:35:14
drops it. And then she wants to make a stop in Floor 2 in the garden, right?

[GM] 23:35:21
Oh, I didn't fully reveal the map. You guys didn't tell me that.

[GM] 23:35:24
Part of it was still hidden on the right.

[GM] 23:35:29
Sorry, all this black, and it's… Yeah, sorry.

[Ink] 23:35:31
Oh, I didn't know if that was… There's stuff in the bottom left that's hidden in the…

[Dex Miro] 23:35:33
Oh, I thought that was intentional.

[GM] 23:35:36
Oh, that one definitely is. And the upper left, yeah, sorry.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:39
Yeah. And the top left is also… That's awesome, awesome. Okay.

[Ink] 23:35:42
I figured out all that. all the authentication was on purpose, yeah.

[GM] 23:35:47
Yeah, no. Here, I'll show you what says ward notes.

[Ink] 23:35:47
Okay, so there was a way from floor 6 here to floor 3.

[Ink] 23:35:53
But for some reason, we think floor 3 is probably the worst floor to go to.

[Ink] 23:35:58
I don't know why I think that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:04
Okay, GM.

[GM] 23:36:06
Mm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:08
Um, so these androids…

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:12
When ripped up,

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:14
are… they have blood in them?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:17
Is that correct? What you said?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:21
Like, it looks like blood?

[GM] 23:36:21
Um, what Androids? Clearly, the room… Androids in this room do not have blood in them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:30
Okay, I'm confused now.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:31
Seems like the troubleshooter androids were something different.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:36
Okay.

[GM] 23:36:38
I mean, the only indication to you guys that they're androids is the fact that the… jump stuck to them, otherwise, for all intents and purposes, they were human.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:46
But it didn't stick to any of our people.

[GM] 23:36:49
No, they're not.

[Ink] 23:36:50
Just you. Just murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:52
just me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:54
And some of these other… some of these

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:57
troublemaker troubleshooters.

[GM] 23:37:00
Yes. And also the… The spider thing that you guys have killed.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:05
But…

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:09
Okay, so maybe they have…

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:11
I'm confused.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:14
What are your theories, guys?

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:17
Because we all have… like, you guys all have cybernetic stuff in you, too. It's not like the, like…

[Ink] 23:37:17
Well, we know that's…

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:24
Right?

[Ink] 23:37:25
Yeah, but we know that, like, this was a robot factor, right? We know that they make some robots that are really hard to distinguish, or Androids that are really hard to distinguish from humans, so there may be…

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:34
Yeah, but I thought that was talking about, like, movement and speech and things like that, not like, like…

[Ink] 23:37:40
And those people thought that they were human. Right? Because they attack you because you're… So they've been obviously made to really, you know, full on Cylon, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:43
Yeah, they thought they were human, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:58
Well, explain to me shy lines! Were Cylons, they were bleed, they bled blood, too?

[Ink] 23:38:05
I didn't actually watch this.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:06
Well, what's the silent?

[GM] 23:38:08
Really? Now you guys watch Battlestar Galactica? Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:11
No, I only watched…

[Dex Miro] 23:38:11
Oh, I watched it, but Dex didn't.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:14
for Boomer, or whatever her name was.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:17
And then… yeah, I was… I didn't pay attention.

[Ink] 23:38:18
The agent… the agent silent? No.

[GM] 23:38:22
I didn't pay attention.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:25
I got… oh, here's a question. Is…

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:28
Did anybody of you… are you… are any of you watch, uh, Stranger Things?

[GM] 23:38:32
Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:38:33
Not yet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:33
I have not started it. Is it worth it?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:38:34
Don't spoil the new… don't spoil the new season.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:37
You've not started season 5, or you've not started the whole series?

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:38
No, I have not watched it at all. I've never… I have not watched Stranger Things at all.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:44
So, is it… should I… is it something worth going through 5 seasons worth?

[GM] 23:38:49
Honestly, I think you could watch season one… I think season one's very good, and… but I…

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:52
Okay, but then it goes downhill.

[GM] 23:38:56
I think so. Honestly, I think when they made Season 1, I don't think they had intentions to, like, continue it.

[GM] 23:39:02
And so you can kind of just watch Season 1 by itself.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:03
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:05
Gotcha. Okay.

[GM] 23:39:07
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:07
I'll keep that in mind. And if it…

[Ink] 23:39:09
That's what I do with Game of Thrones. I watch season one, then skip right to 8 whenever… when it was revealed, and I didn't feel like it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:16
I don't know if I should have done that.

[Ink] 23:39:19
No, like, I couldn't put down season one, and then I, like, watched the first episode of Season 2, and I was like, I don't care if I see the next one.

[GM] 23:39:23
Oh, Season 2 is bad, though, but that gets… they return back to, like, more of the source material for Season 3.

[Ink] 23:39:27
Okay. Because, like, a… I just binged season one. I couldn't, like… I was on an airplane on a trip, and I watched, like, five episodes, and then just… and season two is so boring.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:34
Yeah, seasonable was good. Game of Thrones Season 1 was good, yeah.

[Ink] 23:39:39
But then I didn't feel like I missed… I knew most people in Season 8. I just annoyed the crap out of my roommate trying to explain what… You know, why is that guy missing his dick, you know?

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:52
Okay, back to topic.

[GM] 23:39:55
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:55
Sorry, that was a tangent.

[Ink] 23:39:57
I'm about to… I'm about to binge that, too.

[Ink] 23:40:00
Murderbot, I haven't watched, uh, Stranger Things either.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:01
Yeah, I never watched Stranger Things.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:04
Um, I never watched… and this is… I never watched Breaking Bad, guys.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:40:08
Oh, you gotta watch that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:09
Oh, really? Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:40:11
Yeah.

[GM] 23:40:12
It's pretty dark, uh… I didn't like it, because I was like, this is just… why do these people… why is everyone bad?

[GM] 23:40:20
Why is everyone bad?

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:20
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:40:21
When Malcolm's dad goes really bad, that's when I stopped, I couldn't take it anymore.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:24
Well, that's coming back!

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:26
Malcolm, Malcolm in the Middle's coming back!

[Ink] 23:40:29
0.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:29
So, so is Scrubs!

[Dex Miro] 23:40:30
I mean, it's like a four-up so many series.

[GM] 23:40:30
Is it really?

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:33
Grubs is coming back, Ink!

[Ink] 23:40:35
alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:39
People, they're running out of ideas, man!

[Ink] 23:40:42
I guess so.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:43
It's just bring all the shit back.

[GM] 23:40:45
all of them have AI writers now. They're just…

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:47
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:54
Anyway…

[Ink] 23:40:55
Alright, Dave. And they see pictures?

[GM] 23:40:56
Anyway…

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:02
Um…

[Ink] 23:41:05
I don't know which I like, but Karneck fixing his toes, or… Um, Dex stabbing the spider with the…

[Dex Miro] 23:41:12
My favorite part is that the chatty says Vibe Shreddy on the side of it.

[Ink] 23:41:15
Yes, it does. It glows like that when you activate the vibe part of the Shetty.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:41:16
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:24
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:41:31
Which, which, where are we at right now, GM? You said 58G or 58G?

[GM] 23:41:35
You are currently in 6 dB.

[Ink] 23:41:37
60B, okay.

[Ink] 23:41:42
Alright, so we got more time still? Yeah, we got more time.

[Ink] 23:41:45
can go to 60C?

[GM] 23:41:47
Sure. Um, there is a… Not locked… Alright, it's not locked right.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:55
I guess, before we go any further, did we want to… take… do we want to look at the troubleshooters anymore? Like, is there anything we feel like we could learn from that?

[Dex Miro] 23:42:04
Probably not, they're in fairly small pieces, not to get too gruesome about it.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:16
Yeah, I guess, yeah, let's just go ahead, sorry.

[Ink] 23:42:20
Do we keep the logic course from the VIN? I guess I freaked out last time I touched them, so…

[GM] 23:42:20
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:23
Well, I don't… I don't know that they're gonna have the same kind of logic of ours.

[Ink] 23:42:28
you know, even more valuable ones.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:33
Alright, well that's… I mean, it's worth… it's worth the hour to go back and have a quick look.

[Ink] 23:42:35
Uh, they're waiting.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:39
I guess.

[Ink] 23:42:39
Well, we can get him on the way out, because we have to come back for our ship.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:46
I don't feel like we're gonna be retracing the same route.

[Ink] 23:42:49
I don't think so either. I think we're… because they're gonna film extract us from 3. I don't know.

[GM] 23:42:59
Do you want to go back and check out the bodies some more?

[Dex Miro] 23:43:01
Yeah, I think… I think we should have a look.

[GM] 23:43:03
Okay. Uh, you effectively spend an hour there and back, um, but when you get to the bodies.

[GM] 23:43:12
Uh, there's no obvious way. to extract Logic Core.

[GM] 23:43:18
Like, this definitely looks like a human. You, like, kind of, like, the same sort of panel access or whatever for… extracting a logic cores on a normal Android.

[GM] 23:43:30
It's not there.

[Ink] 23:43:32
I saw this in Westworld. It's a little… Metal cubit, or sphere in these guys.

[Dex Miro] 23:43:41
I mean, is there, like…

[GM] 23:43:43
Where's that sphere held? Alright, you gonna crack that sucker open again?

[Ink] 23:43:44
Inside their brain.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:46
No, no!

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:49
No!

[Ink] 23:43:51
He's not going here, anywhere near those bastards.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:52
I will do it!

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:54
If anything, don't touch it.

[Ink] 23:43:58
Wow, so… Oh, yeah, where's our xenobiologist?

[Ink] 23:44:03
Can he dissect these dudes?

[Ink] 23:44:08
What is it?

[GM] 23:44:09
They're calling Zeke up to the plate, you know?

[GM] 23:44:12
Effectively, yeah, do a little autopsy on them. All right, montage.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:15
Sure.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:18
Nice montage.

[GM] 23:44:21
butchering a body montage.

[Ink] 23:44:21
Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:21
montage!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:21
Include

[Dex Miro] 23:44:25
Dear.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:27
It's my only useful skill.

[GM] 23:44:30
He's got the montage skill.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:34
They bring body montages, my useful…

[Dex Miro] 23:44:34
I think that pseudobiology, but…

[GM] 23:44:39
Um, okay, um… Zeke, make an intelligence check when you can add your xenobiology to it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:53
Um, what is…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:57
What number do I add? I'm a master at that.

[GM] 23:45:01
20, I think, is a master. because I think it was 10, 15, 20.

[GM] 23:45:05
Okay. Um, okay. You… essentially do an autopsy.

[GM] 23:45:12
Um, for all intents and purposes. This is a human. Um… you go through, like, the tissue is an exact replication of tissue of a human.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:17
Wow.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:23
Whoa.

[GM] 23:45:24
organs are all in the right place, um… And by… with a little bit of luck, you actually do find.

[GM] 23:45:30
Effectively, a piece of metal that. small, unlike any other logic core that you… Um, could think of, but does seem… Um, to operate within the brain cavity.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:31
Whoa.

[GM] 23:45:46
So, in using sort of the help of, uh… Um… the… Android detector that you guys have, the mobile one that, um, I think it's… Murderbot's carrying it, right? Um, you are able to determine that that is indeed, like, an Android part.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:56
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:57
I got… yup.

[GM] 23:46:04
Um, and that you also come to the conclusion that, you know, should you come across any of these androids again.

[GM] 23:46:11
That it would be easy to overlook. Um, or bypass the scanning capabilities of this device.

[GM] 23:46:19
Now that you know, sort of, where and how this.

[GM] 23:46:22
they function, you probably, you know, assuming they submit to a scan.

[GM] 23:46:26
could determine whether they were an android or not.

[GM] 23:46:29
Um… but…

[Ink] 23:46:31
The Logic Core store? Where will you find the silver piece?

[GM] 23:46:34
Uh, well, the unfortunate piece is that. it could be anywhere in the body.

[GM] 23:46:39
This one just happens to be in the brain because.

[GM] 23:46:42
That's what Westworld said, right? Um, but… But, um… but Zeke tells you, like, yeah, it's… It's, uh, you know.

[GM] 23:46:52
the design of this is, uh… you know, beyond most human understanding, um, the ability to control.

[GM] 23:47:03
A being using, you know, this type of. Material slash, um, you know, sort of like the… processing power, and then in addition to, like.

[GM] 23:47:13
have an interface with essentially a human body, um… It's quite advanced.

[GM] 23:47:19
So, um… Yeah, uh… I think Zeke, though, probably doesn't want to go through and take the time to collect all the other Logic cores on account of, um… It, you know, it's effectively…

[GM] 23:47:33
Yeah, it's fine to do an autopsy, but it takes time, and digging through a body just.

[GM] 23:47:39
Just to try and find these is probably not.

[GM] 23:47:42
neither worth his time nor, um, is it… settling on the stomach, so…

[Ink] 23:47:47
Yeah, and it… ChatGPT just censored him. Uh, doing the… anyway.

[GM] 23:47:51
Yeah. No autopsies for Zeke.

[Ink] 23:47:55
They actually started to render and then stop.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:59
So the… like, are you saying that. If we just scan, like, the part of the body that doesn't have that in it, like, it has no idea that we're scanning an Android.

[GM] 23:48:08
Right.

[Ink] 23:48:11
So before, we would have scanned these guys, and they would have come up human, and we would have been fooled.

[GM] 23:48:15
Yep. I mean, assuming you didn't get their head in, or at least this guy's head.

[Ink] 23:48:21
Yeah, but now we know to look for this piece, and we know a little bit more how to detect it, maybe?

[GM] 23:48:26
Yeah. You can… it probably would have shown up as an anomaly, uh, not something that would have triggered, like, any kind of warning that this was an Android, but not… you can maybe, like.

[GM] 23:48:37
pinpoint the focus of the device, the scan, and any anomalies, like.
