[Ink] 21:56:10
That are trouble.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:16
Shit, what do we do? What do we do? What do I do with you?

[Dex Miro] 21:56:26
So they didn't, like, leave us in the room, right? They're… they're still sitting right in front of us, and… We're all just spilling our guts.

[GM] 21:56:34
Um…

[GM] 21:56:40
Yeah, for the most part.

[GM] 21:56:46
Um… Let's see…

[GM] 21:56:52
1, 2, 3…

[Dex Miro] 21:56:53
I have an AutoMed, like, am I coherent enough to… use that to get the drugs out of my system.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:01
An auto what?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:02
I don't remember what an AutoMed is, but I have an eye. Let me see if it's in the PDF.

[Ink] 21:57:05
You're allowed to keep it on you, if that's not cyberware, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:11
Right. Like, that was from, like, our gear before the mission or something.

[Ink] 21:57:15
Yeah. It's not a weapon, so they wouldn't have necessarily stripped you of it, huh?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:17
I'm assuming the company didn't take it back from me, but maybe they would have.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:25
Uh, let me see what it is, even.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:29
So, are we in the room by ourselves right now? What's just the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:33
What's going on?

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:34
I think you guys are being interrogated.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:36
actively?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:39
Or is there… so, like…

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:39
No?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:43
A guards in the world?

[GM] 21:57:43
Probably a little… probably a little bit of interrogation. Um, insofar as that came in.

[GM] 21:57:50
As you, sort of… But… what the plan was, and um…

[GM] 21:57:59
Yeah, they… Luckily, um…

[GM] 21:58:05
Speaking in code… with, uh, with… Yandy, about what was to happen.

[GM] 21:58:13
Has been… allowed you guys to at least a little bit… hide what… what the intention was, um…

[GM] 21:58:20
I don't know, just everyone go ahead and make, like, a sanity save.

[Ink] 21:58:20
So we… So we know what we have told them, right? That, like, we just kind of blurted out and understand that we spilled the beans.

[GM] 21:58:27
Yeah. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:58:32
So that, um, like, a sanity set.

[GM] 21:58:36
Oh, I didn't mean Murderbot, but that's fine.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:40
I'm freaking out, man!

[Ink] 21:58:48
Alright, nice job, robot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:52
To take a stress.

[Ink] 21:58:55
Gratis. Oh! Double 99, the worst I could roll, plus it's doubled.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:56
Row.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:58:56
Unbelievable.

[Ink] 21:59:01
I went insane. Amy.

[GM] 21:59:01
Yeah. Yeah. Green means good.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:01
But it's growing in green means good.

[Ink] 21:59:07
Real good. Boom. Don't go nut.

[GM] 21:59:09
Um, yeah. So… Yeah. Ink just… just… he, like…

[GM] 21:59:16
Opens up his shirt, he shows him the cyberware, he just… he just… he just crumples under… He was like, we were on the ship, we got all the stuff, decided where everyone's got cyberware now, it's… everyone's got it.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:17
Short it up. Oh my god, somebody stop him!

[Ink] 21:59:22
Look at my cool gills!

[Ink] 21:59:32
So many freaking knock him out!

[GM] 21:59:36
He was like, we're supposed to kill you, and then we got… we're gonna get paid a ton of money for it. It's way better than anything the company could ever give us.

[GM] 21:59:46
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:47
So none of us could, like, try to… told to shut up during any of this.

[GM] 21:59:54
He gets it out all pretty quick. You're all a little bit fucked up from the… And the actual drugs itself.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:56
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:00:01
Um… Yeah, um…

[GM] 22:00:05
The… the CEO turns to the spokesman and tells him, like, okay, we're gonna have to…

[GM] 22:00:14
Convene on this, uh, and they… get up and they go to leave the room, um…

[Dex Miro] 22:00:21
Wait, so he even said we were planning to kill the CEO.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:25
We weren't planning on killing the CEO.

[GM] 22:00:25
Yeah, he loved it. I just… it was… So… it's great.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:29
Well, we weren't. Yeah.

[GM] 22:00:30
Critical failure there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:32
I mean, we're just planning on taking a briefcase, and we don't know what it does.

[Ink] 22:00:35
Maybe you guys… maybe you guys should have ejected me into space.

[GM] 22:00:35
Oh, no, he… he… Ink knows what the intention was. He let the intention out as well. There's no holding back on this.

[Ink] 22:00:46
Okay, so then, what about one other key thing? Do they know that?

[GM] 22:00:51
About Murderbot yet? No, you didn't have any time to tell them about that.

[Ink] 22:00:54
Okay, well, even though I said the… Oh, gotcha. Okay, so they, they, they know that the intention was to kill them, but did ID detail in deeper of, like, how…

[GM] 22:00:57
No, just… your video says that you said that, but that's not actually… yeah.

[Ink] 22:01:08
We were going to accomplish that?

[GM] 22:01:10
No. No, you didn't. You didn't get it out in time. They got up and left before then.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:01:14
Well, we don't know that we're actually gonna kill the guy, do we? We're just delivering the suitcase.

[Ink] 22:01:14
Okay.

[Ink] 22:01:21
Insane balls of fire.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:25
Happens to be… we know it happens to be radioactive, but that doesn't necessarily mean…

[Ink] 22:01:26
We like to…

[Dex Miro] 22:01:26
Did I make

[GM] 22:01:31
If you as a player think the intention was to blow this ship up with that briefcase, then your character thinks that same thing.

[GM] 22:01:39
And with the fact that he rolled Critical Fail, he divulged what he thought.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:45
But my character's player in real life is stupid.

[Ink] 22:01:49
I'm like, wait.

[GM] 22:01:49
Well, you're also not the one that ruled the critical fail, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:01:50
Hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:55
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:59
Alright, I got a plan. Somebody has to go to the bathroom.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:02
And then I'll turn on my cloaking device and sneak out.

[Ink] 22:02:06
Ooh, I like that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:09
Well, yeah, you do have a cloaking device.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:11
I don't think they're gonna let you go use the bathroom right now.

[Ink] 22:02:14
But if I start puking?

[GM] 22:02:16
Well, if you tell them what's in the bathroom?

[Ink] 22:02:21
There's nothing in the bathroom.

[GM] 22:02:26
When ink thinks that he's like, shoot, I put the suitcase in the bathroom.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:31
He just…

[Ink] 22:02:32
I put the bomb in the bathroom!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:33
He's just spewing things by association now.

[Ink] 22:02:41
No, that's what I was getting at. I didn't know if I revealed that, GM.

[GM] 22:02:44
You have not yet revealed that. Not to them, at least. You might have revealed it to the rest of the party, but…

[Ink] 22:02:46
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:02:52
Hmm.

[Ink] 22:02:53
Alright, can I, uh, can I chug more of that good apple juice and puke?

[GM] 22:03:03
You… yes, I mean, it's more than just apple juice. I mean, they brought you, like, food and stuff that, like.

[Ink] 22:03:08
I'm just gonna start gorging myself, and I'm gonna really just lean into the drug, and make the truth seem way oversized, so that they start to just think that I'm just crazy, not that I'm telling the truth anymore.

[GM] 22:03:20
Yeah, so you start going into your childhood. Traumas and, like, really digging into it like a therapy session, um…

[GM] 22:03:28
And uh… between that and the, uh… overeating, you definitely quickly make yourself sick.

[GM] 22:03:36
Um…

[Ink] 22:03:38
I need a space toilet. Toilet.

[GM] 22:03:43
Um…

[GM] 22:03:47
Yeah, the… you know, there's nobody in the room with you guys, but a guard opens up the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:55
I've activated my cloaking device.

[GM] 22:03:56
Okay. They open up the… or as the door is opening up, you turn invisible. Um…

[Ink] 22:03:57
Okay? Look.

[GM] 22:04:06
They take ink, uh, there's two of them, and you can see outside the door, there's, like, two more.

[GM] 22:04:12
Um, and they… without saying much, they grab ink. Uh, and start to pull them out of the room.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:19
Uh-oh.

[GM] 22:04:19
Um… then…

[GM] 22:04:24
I guess, before the door closes, Zeke, you want to sneak out?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:27
Yeah, very quietly walking behind Ink, who's being very loud.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:32
To guise the noise.

[Ink] 22:04:32
Oh, man, I'm making a… I'm making a show. Totally.

[GM] 22:04:35
Yeah, you… you're telling… How much your parents loved you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:39
That'd be funny, as he's being pulled away, he goes. Look up, guys! Fuckin' cloaking his shit!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:48
Huh?

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:49
Look at Club!

[Ink] 22:04:51
No, I'm just gonna yell. I'm gonna explode, I'm gonna explode, and they just think it's the throw-up, but I'm really talking about the biomass.

[GM] 22:04:58
Yeah. Um… Zeke, you… you…

[GM] 22:05:05
Hear one of the guards say that they're basically taking ink to the med bay, because they don't want him to… to die just yet, so…

[Ink] 22:05:13
You're greedy.

[GM] 22:05:15
Um, are you gonna follow them to the MedBay, or are you going somewhere else on their ship?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:17
I'll go somewhere else. I don't really know where else to go, but I will go somewhere else.

[GM] 22:05:22
You've spent enough time on this ship that you have a good sense of its layout.

[GM] 22:05:25
You wouldn't get lost or anything. There's generally major points of interest would be.

[GM] 22:05:31
The home, the brig. Medbay, um, the docking area where your ship is, um…

[GM] 22:05:41
The armory, but the armory is also adjacent to where, essentially, the brig is, which is essentially where.

[GM] 22:05:46
You know, the, um, security officers are… Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:52
Do I know how the door…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:56
opens? Like, is it being… is there, like, a key, or is it open from some central location?

[GM] 22:06:02
Yeah, so it's… automatically opens… Except for when locked, and then when locked, it requires a keycard.

[GM] 22:06:10
To open.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:11
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:14
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:16
Uh, presumably…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:18
So, I know the briefcase is in the bathroom, and I don't really think there's much to do there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:24
Um, and I don't know where Murderbot is, presumably.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:28
He just…

[GM] 22:06:28
Um, you assume he's on the ship at this point, because he's… told the group.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:28
Yes, you do. Because that's what we were talking about, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:34
So I guess I'd like to go see if I could find Murderbot, if I… if I think he's back on the ship.

[GM] 22:06:34
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:39
That would be a smart idea.

[GM] 22:06:41
Okay. Um… You get back to the ship pretty quickly, um…

[GM] 22:06:49
You are able even to… uh, likely de-cloak… And people wouldn't, you know, if you played it cool, you'd probably be…

[GM] 22:06:57
People would be unassuming about you being in the halls and whatnot, you're… There's nothing sort of indicating.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:00
Yeah.

[GM] 22:07:03
There's no, like, ship-wide announcement of, like, keep an eye out for these guys, like, they don't know that you've essentially escaped yet.

[GM] 22:07:09
As far as you can tell. Um… And when you get back to the ship, you can… you see, like, they've already unloaded.

[GM] 22:07:18
Like, a couple of bins of weapons and things from the ship.

[GM] 22:07:22
Um… So you don't see the people that are doing this. Meanwhile, Murderbot, you're on the ship, and you can see them still, like, packing things up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:34
Um, would I be able to… Do I have the… the receptors to pick up on…

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:43
Zeke's, uh… invisibility, or no?

[GM] 22:07:48
I don't know what would give you that ability.

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:51
God, Moat, no. Um…

[GM] 22:07:55
I mean, it is a heads-up display, right? Or something like that?

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:59
Now, it gives a plus… gives… I'm guessing… Plus, or gives advantage?

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:07
On hacking?

[GM] 22:08:08
Mm, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:11
That's, like, things you're connected to, right?

[GM] 22:08:13
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:15
All right, what else do I have? I've got Espernetic feedback loop.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:20
Psionic attack… that overloads targeted electronics.

[Ink] 22:08:27
Oh, that one's interesting. Will that hurt him?

[GM] 22:08:31
Uh, no, because it's… Targeted, yeah, it's targeted. I mean, if you shot himself with it, I suppose he could.

[Ink] 22:08:32
It's targeted.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:33
An attack.

[Ink] 22:08:39
Don't do that.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:40
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:41
Um, looky-loo is the… pickup transmissions… And then VoxBox perfectly mimic any voice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:56
So… that's that. I got nothing. I can't even see… I can't even see Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:10
Like, it's too clever. But I'm sure if he's gonna talk to me, he'll… or… Or communicate with me, he'll…

[Dex Miro] 22:09:17
I mean, didn't he de-cloak, or… Was that just something GM said?

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:19
Tap me on the shoulder or something.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:24
I don't know, how long can you seek stay cloaked for?

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:28
That is a good question.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:34
Did Zeke Freeze? Looks like Zeke Fries.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:35
Sorry, I had to fill out my computer.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:38
Oh, like Scott.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:38
I'm back.

[GM] 22:09:44
Hogskin says 5 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:45
Oh! Did he make it over in 5 minutes?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:51
Can you guys hear me?

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:52
Yes.

[GM] 22:09:52
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:53
Yes.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:53
I just shut my computer. I don't know why the camera didn't go back on, but whatever.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:59
Um, I mean, my inclination is to just wait

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:03
around until they're done unloading the ship, unless it looks like you're gonna take forever.

[GM] 22:10:10
Um… based on what you think they're doing, as far as, like, collecting.

[GM] 22:10:16
Arms from the ship, as well as, like, any other company property.

[GM] 22:10:20
You don't think they'll be taking too much longer?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:23
Right.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:27
As long as I'll just wait till they're done. When they're done, I'll…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:29
try to climb aboard by Merva.

[GM] 22:10:33
Yeah. Uh, you see them come out with… last remaining bins, uh, they put them on, like, a…

[GM] 22:10:40
Little cart, and then they start to haul them away, um… You're able to easily.

[GM] 22:10:47
Get around them, they're not looking for you or anything, and even if they did notice you, they don't pay you any money.

[GM] 22:10:53
Mind. Um… You get on the ship.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:00
Erbach?

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:04
There's no one on… there's no one on the ship, right?

[GM] 22:11:07
I mean, maybe you're on the ship, but… Yeah, no, the other people have left.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:08
No, no, I mean, the other three people that I observed.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:14
Yeah. What's Zeke's character's name again?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:18
Drink from your finger to song.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:20
Reek? Oh, Zeke. Zeke! I'm here! What are you doing?

[GM] 22:11:21
Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:25
We're in trouble, we're in trouble, Murderbot!

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:25
Dude, did we… did we get the reward? Oh, what happened? Tell me everything.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:28
We're in trouble!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:31
Well, they know everything.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:35
And ink doesn't feel good, and they know everything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:35
What do you mean they know everything? What… what is… what do you mean they know everything?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:42
Uh, well, no, I mean, they know…

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:42
They know about the plan? They know about the suitcase?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:48
No, but they know that we want to murder them all.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:53
Why would you tell them that? Oh, boy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:54
And they're in the break.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:57
We told them it because of the apple juice. Never drink the apple juice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:01
Apple juice? You guys had apple juice? Um… Okay, so where is everybody right now?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:09
During the break.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:11
Okay, so what do you think we should do? How do you… how do you… how do you…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:14
rescue them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:19
How do you propose we do that? What?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:22
Well, you're, I mean, you're a murder bot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:26
Start with the murdering.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:28
Is that your way of telling me I should go murder? I only take orders from Karnak.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:36
you have to save Carnoc!

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:39
Alright, that's… this is true, I have to go save Carnoc.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:41
Well, um, GM, did… did they take Carnax weapons and all that stuff in one of those bins?

[GM] 22:12:48
Oh, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:48
Do I know… was I able to figure out which one of the… the employees… had the VIN, so we can follow, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:01
Chase that guy, or no? Is that far… is that all gone?

[GM] 22:13:04
You use… they're not far ahead of you, they're, you know.

[GM] 22:13:08
If… based on your calculations, you could catch them before they reach the armory, and you assume they're taking things to the armory on account of there being many weapons.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:14
Okay. Gotcha. And is there anything left on the… on the ship that I could pick up and use as weapons, or any… a spanner? What's a spanner?

[GM] 22:13:21
There's a spanner.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:24
Banners are the best weapons.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:27
What's a spanner? Oh…

[GM] 22:13:29
It's like a giant wrench.

[Ink] 22:13:32
They left his favorite spanner, at least?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:34
Okay, I'll pick up the spanner for now. Okay, I'll pick up the spanner and…

[GM] 22:13:35
They thought it was a tool for fixing the ship, they didn't realize it was a weapon.

[Ink] 22:13:41
Didn't see the carc blood on it?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:46
I'll pick up the spanner, start heading toward the armory, and hopefully try and catch the last guy, or one of the guys.

[GM] 22:13:55
Um, okay. Is, uh, Zeke following along with him?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:59
Zeke is following along. Zeke, what else… what else did you have to do something to the ship, or did you want to, like, send out for help, or did you want to, like, prep the ship ready to go, or what do you think?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:00
I'll follow along.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:11
Does the ship need to get prepped?

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:13
I mean, if we want to make a quick getaway, right? Or if we want to get off this thing.

[GM] 22:14:14
Uh… The thing you don't… the ship will power up pretty quickly. It's a matter of getting the, uh, bay doors open.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:21
Oh, okay. Oh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:26
We need to… we need… we need the bay doors open before we… I gotta do fucking everything!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:29
probably would need you to hack into the computer to do that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:33
Well, yeah, pretty much. I mean, is there any, like, xenobiology for me to do on board this ship?

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:39
Fuck, I'm only one person here! God damn it!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:43
You're like R2 Dieto, you gotta, like, plug into all the things.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:44
We got one guy tripping balls.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:46
You know, first you open the brig, then you start the trash compactor, and then you, you know, open the bay doors, and you gotta do the things.

[Ink] 22:14:53
You just insert your dongle into the different…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:54
Exactly, insert the dongle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:57
All right, well, um, GM, is it a quick thing for me to open up the bay doors, and will that set up any alarms to be like, hey, there's something wrong going on over here?

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:08
Or is it just, like, I can open up the doors?

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:12
Without having anybody notice.

[GM] 22:15:13
Uh… Do you… could hack the doors right now, and not open them, but, like.

[GM] 22:15:19
Prep them, but there's a chance that, um… the system resets, or, you know, should you trigger an alarm of some kind?

[GM] 22:15:28
That they'd be locked down, you'd have to do the process all over again.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:31
I see.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:40
How about I…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:47
How about I try opening the doors right now? We're fucked anyway.

[GM] 22:15:52
Is your intention to still try and catch up to the weapons?

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:52
Let's hack. Oh, is it one or the other?

[GM] 22:15:56
It's not, but you'd have to make a speed check. So, yeah, essentially you'd have to take a speed check. You're gonna try and hack this thing really fast.

[GM] 22:16:05
Um, you would still get whatever bonus you have for hacking, plus advantage because of the god mode.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:10
Yeah.

[GM] 22:16:11
Um. If you succeed, then you likely have time enough to catch the…

[GM] 22:16:16
The weapons. Okay. Speed check, you get the bonus if you have hacking.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:16
Okay, let's do it. I'm a rock star.

[GM] 22:16:25
Which I assume is a skill that… Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:30
Is it a skill? I got computers.

[GM] 22:16:31
I don't know. Looking at my sheet now.

[GM] 22:16:41
Hacking is a skill. Is it on your sheet?

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:42
Damn it. Yeah…

[GM] 22:16:50
I guess, yeah, I'll let you have the plus 10 from the computers. I mean, you're working on it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:53
Yeah…

[GM] 22:16:54
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:16:58
Oh, in that picture that I uploaded of ink throwing up, Zeke's in that picture, you just can't see him because he's cloaked.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:17:05
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:09
Um, GM, what's the… what's the role? Speed?

[GM] 22:17:13
Speed. Advantage, because we got god mode, and then he had plus 10 as a modifier.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:14
Normal, advantage, disadvantage?

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:20
Must send modifier.

[GM] 22:17:23
Okay, critical success. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:26
Yes! Let's fucking go!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:17:27
They're almost…

[GM] 22:17:31
You plug your dongle in. You greet the computer.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:36
Ooh, yeah, take my dongle computer.

[GM] 22:17:39
Yeah, you do it sexy style. You're… you flirt with the computer a little bit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:17:40
I don't like that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:46
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

[GM] 22:17:47
It likes that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:17:50
It is a happy computer.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:52
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

[GM] 22:17:53
You convince it to lock anybody else out, and so, uh… you know, you're… you… you want to be the only one to open up its bay doors.

[GM] 22:18:03
Um, so… You, you, uh… you don't have any fear of any kind of… even if alarm was raised, you feel like the computer's gonna let you open these.

[GM] 22:18:13
Uh, the bay doors without any resistance, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:16
Nice. All right.

[GM] 22:18:21
So then, I guess, is Zeke going to go with you then, since he's useless at opening up bay doors?

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:25
Yeah, Zinc might be better if he cloaks and knocks the guy out, but… I don't know, Zeke has the ability to do that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:18:37
Because all kinds of abilities.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:38
So it might just be me having to… pop, pop this guy in the head.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:46
Um… What do you think, Zeke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:18:50
I'll follow your lead, you tell me what you want me to do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:00
Does having… Um, having invisibility give him any bonuses to, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:08
Uh… um… like a, uh, a sticky strike, or anything like that, GM, or…

[GM] 22:19:15
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:17
Okay. But what's your combat at? Zeke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:22
combat, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:25
I'm guessing it's combat, right, GM? The role, or…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:28
Not… not good.

[GM] 22:19:29
Depends. I don't know, depends what's… if it's gonna be a matter of him…

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:31
Or strength?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:33
34.

[GM] 22:19:35
Swingin', uh… Spanner to knock somebody else, then it's probably, like, a strength check, actually.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:39
Trying not… yeah, knock the guy out with the spanner, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:43
Oh, strength?

[GM] 22:19:44
If he's invisible, if the person doesn't see it coming. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:48
You know, I'm a scrawny scientist.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:52
my strength is…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:52
Is the spanner also visible if he's holding a spanner? Is this banner also invisible if Zeke's holding a spanner uncloaked?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:54
35.

[GM] 22:19:55
What's that, Dex? Kind of.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:03
Um, my strength's at 35, too, so you might have a better shot because you're, uh… cloaked.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:08
All right, I'm as strong as a robot. Makes me feel better.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:14
Well… I mean, I was… I was built in the form of an average man, so…

[Ink] 22:20:16
He's trying to throw a book.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:25
All right, so… Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:20:25
Um, meanwhile, back in the holding cell, uh, is there anything that, uh, Carnoc and… Um, DEX1 to do.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:35
Are we still, like, affected by the drugs, or…

[GM] 22:20:39
You were… you were… you're… way more under control than Karnak is.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:44
Okay. Do I know if the auto-med things would help this or not?

[GM] 22:20:50
Yeah, you'd think so. At least would, you know, potentially.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:52
Okay.

[GM] 22:20:55
Stop Karnak from revealing, like, a lot of his innermost feelings about things.

[Dex Miro] 22:21:00
Okay. Well, assuming the company didn't take those away from me, like, I'll… give them carnocluentamide and tell them to take this.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:21:10
Right? I don't think…

[Dex Miro] 22:21:10
I don't know if he accepts that, or… Well, the truth serum stuff just makes you, like, kind of out of it, right? It doesn't…

[GM] 22:21:19
Yeah, makes them a little fuzzy-brained, but… This, hopefully.

[GM] 22:21:24
Wake him up a little bit. Alright, chase it with some apple juice.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:21:26
Yeah, I'll take that.

[Dex Miro] 22:21:30
No, not the other Jews.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:21:31
I don't have an apple biz.

[GM] 22:21:34
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:21:35
Dex will have to slap the juice box out of his head.

[GM] 22:21:41
Um, after a couple minutes, Carnax starts to feel… quite a bit more himself, uh…

[GM] 22:21:49
Is there other… anything else you guys want to do while… while in this… room, there's, like, a glass… window, you know, use them as a one-way mirror.

[GM] 22:21:59
Um. And then, uh… you know, there's some guards outside the door.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:08
But there's, like, nothing at all in the room, because it's meant to be an interrogation cell, effectively, right?

[GM] 22:22:14
There's a table and chairs.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:20
Um, but there's no window to the outside, right?

[GM] 22:22:25
To outer space? No. No.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:26
No, I mean, like, even the hallway. No, no.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:22:33
Does my ogre allowed me to see through the one white mirror?

[GM] 22:22:37
Mmm… you could maybe try to reprogram it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:22:39
Roughly, though.

[GM] 22:22:43
To be able to do that.

[GM] 22:22:49
But the risk is, um… if you've critically fail, you would permanently damage your ogre.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:22:58
Yeah, I'll just… not try that fun.

[GM] 22:23:04
Oh, come on. Critical failures are pretty infrequent. Just so ha-.

[Ink] 22:23:08
Yeah, alright, I read it all today, I think.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:23:09
There's just, like, a 10% chance of it happening. Well, maybe, maybe, maybe 8% or something, yeah.

[GM] 22:23:13
But it's a little less than that. Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:23:17
Depending on what stat I was.

[GM] 22:23:19
Where your skill level is, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:29
I want to use my… I can't remember the name of these things.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:23:30
Yeah, I don't know that I want to do anything. What about you?

[Dex Miro] 22:23:42
Yeah. Wouldn't… I'm assuming I would have gotten enough voice samples of both.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:49
Devin and the CEO that I could, like, synthesize them.

[GM] 22:23:54
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:55
Okay. So… Do we remember if the guards the token caught, did they have, like, weapons?

[GM] 22:24:03
Yes. Uh, they had sidearms.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:06
Okay, so we'd have to try to overpower both of the guards then.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:13
Does Carnaug think we can do that? I don't have a sentence for these military things.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:17
Wow. I have a hunter shot that I'm assuming they don't know about.

[GM] 22:24:23
They definitely… I mean, they know that you have cyberware, but they don't know the ins and outs of what you have, like… everything seems pretty innocuous.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:28
Okay.

[GM] 22:24:31
What you do have, right? Like… Um… you know, Inc. Did show off his, like, vents and stuff, so, like, they're like, oh, well…

[GM] 22:24:41
Okay, so we can't see everything, but some of the things we can see… Yeah. They didn't seem like…

[GM] 22:24:50
To be afraid of you guys in a way that you felt like a lethal threat because of some of your… cyberware. Hold on one second. Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:24:59
But, I mean, I don't know that we really want to start murdering people.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:04
Yeah…

[Ink] 22:25:07
I mean, they're all gonna die anyway when the bomb blows up.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:09
If only I'd gotten the fangs. Yeah, well, you're not here, are you?

[Ink] 22:25:11
I have the fangs. I know, but I'm in the medbay about to bite somebody.

[GM] 22:25:23
Okay, um, so yeah, they seem unaware of your… the possible threats of… What do you guys have going?

[Dex Miro] 22:25:31
Yeah, because that's… We'd have to at least try to knock them out if we did get them to open the door.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:39
And you're, um, hunter shot or whatever might just kill one of them.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:45
So… Yeah, I guess we'll just stay put.

[GM] 22:25:51
Okay. Alright. And in the MedBay.

[GM] 22:25:56
Um, ink their… basically dragging you, you know, one guy's got.

[GM] 22:26:02
On the other side of you, like, kind of hoisting you underneath your shoulder.

[GM] 22:26:07
Um… And they're… when they get you to the med bay, they, um…

[GM] 22:26:15
Basically, there's a, like, an on-site doctor, maybe a nurse as well.

[GM] 22:26:20
Uh, and they ask, you know, what's going on, and they said that.

[GM] 22:26:24
Um, that you… have vomited, um…

[GM] 22:26:30
And they think it might have been a potential. Suicide attempt based on all of the trauma that you're talking about, and just won't stop talking about all your trauma?

[GM] 22:26:40
Um, so they think that they… Didn't need to restrain you.

[GM] 22:26:44
Um, and that, in particular, the CEO. Once you're alive, to be able to question you further, so…

[GM] 22:26:50
You know, they want to make sure nothing happens to you.

[Ink] 22:26:54
If I get one of those white jackets, don't I? But not the muzzle.

[GM] 22:26:54
Um…

[GM] 22:27:00
Not yet, they haven't yet, uh… They're just, like, the doctor's like, well, we could put them in…

[GM] 22:27:06
One of these, uh… Medbays and just, uh, you know, restrain them to the table so he can't hurt himself.

[GM] 22:27:13
And they're like, okay. So they… open the door and bring you into one of the bays. There's, like, sort of an operating table they put you on.

[GM] 22:27:20
And they have just, like… Pretty simple Velcro straps that are gonna… Probably put it on your, uh, your arms and stuff.

[GM] 22:27:31
Yeah. They… apparently they don't think of you as much of a threat either, so far as that they just kind of… Strap your arms down, um, and they even leave your feet free.

[Ink] 22:27:45
Do the security guards leave? Okay, so then I just have a nurse, a doctor to contend with?

[GM] 22:27:47
Yeah. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:27:51
Okay, cool. Um…

[Ink] 22:27:56
And I can't send any signal out. My, uh… do I still have control over my… what was my thing called?

[Ink] 22:28:10
My little bug. It flies around and tells you what to mind… my…

[Ink] 22:28:17
Okay. What is this thing called? My tattletale.

[GM] 22:28:23
If that's one of your… cyberware slash slickware things, then yeah.

[Ink] 22:28:28
The detachable audio surveillance bug, which can be traced up to… okay, so… Um, can I get any information from my tattletale as far as audio? Like, uh…

[Ink] 22:28:38
I don't know, I guess, do I control where it goes?

[GM] 22:28:41
Sure.

[Ink] 22:28:47
So I guess I'd like to keep… yeah, I guess I'll keep it on the CEO for right now, so that should be able to kind of track what he's doing.

[Ink] 22:28:52
So I don't… do I have any additional information from what the CEOs.

[Ink] 22:28:56
Planning right now?

[GM] 22:29:01
Um, so you're getting audio feedback from… You're a tattletail from… that's around the CEO.

[Ink] 22:29:04
The CEO. Yeah.

[GM] 22:29:07
Um… Yeah, um…

[GM] 22:29:14
Pretty much, he… he's processing the data that you guys have presented him with the Smoky Man. Essentially.

[GM] 22:29:24
Um… He's like, there's a good chance that most of the…

[GM] 22:29:29
Uh, information's been faked, uh, but it also… demonstrates an understanding of.

[GM] 22:29:36
Um, the company's policies and procedures in a way that, you know.

[GM] 22:29:40
Makes it very realistic, such that there might even be a mole.

[GM] 22:29:44
Um… You know, and he's hoping to essentially.

[GM] 22:29:49
Get that information out of somebody on your team. There's even an element where… He's hoping that perhaps he could convince you guys to…

[GM] 22:30:00
Um, worked for the company again by offering you, um. Larger stake promotions and whatnot.

[GM] 22:30:08
Um. And then, obviously, you know, being…

[GM] 22:30:14
The shareholders wouldn't like that very much, and so you guys would have to be eliminated before, uh, you'd have to actually pay out to you guys.

[Ink] 22:30:22
Okay, so he might offer something. Let us go to do something, and then blow us up after he uses us.

[GM] 22:30:28
Essentially. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:30:29
This… okay. But, okay, so, but we could play… but now I know that we could play along and accept his offer.

[Ink] 22:30:37
And, well, I guess, yeah, he'd probably do something to double-cross us, right? Install those switches and all of us, so he'd blow us all out.

[Ink] 22:30:46
Okay. Well, I'm gonna sit… What's that?

[Dex Miro] 22:30:47
I didn't think about that. I didn't think about that, I'm much easier to install a panic switch into now.

[Ink] 22:30:54
Right? Because you're a cyber word. Alright, well, I'll, uh, I'll sit quiet for a minute and act like I'm complying then here, and I guess try to work my, uh.

[Ink] 22:31:02
Restraints quietly, if that makes sense.

[GM] 22:31:05
Okay. Um… Do you have any particular skill or anything that would be helpful for you to…

[Ink] 22:31:12
Um, jury rigging… And… first age and…

[Ink] 22:31:17
Scavenging and heavy machinery and pathology. Oh, and zero-g. So if the gravity was cut, man, I'd be awesome.

[Ink] 22:31:28
Uh… Scavaging mechanical repairs… yeah, so I'd say…

[Ink] 22:31:34
Jury raking might give me a little bit of an advantage to… undoing restraints.

[GM] 22:31:40
Did you have any sort of inventory item on your person that would help assist in jerry rigging?

[Ink] 22:31:47
Um, let's see… said I had a rigging gun, a shovel, a salvage drone.

[Ink] 22:31:52
I don't think I have any of these things more on me yet.

[Ink] 22:31:56
On my hands, you know. No, just… just the fork.

[Ink] 22:32:02
That I was eating the applesauce with, you know.

[GM] 22:32:05
Okay. It's… it's more of a spork. That's how the…

[Ink] 22:32:11
Yeah, exactly, that's… it wouldn't be very good for applesauce, you're right.

[GM] 22:32:14
But it's the… it's actually… I don't know what a sporked knife is called, where it has one sharp edge.

[GM] 22:32:22
Because you have to be able to cut… cut things as well.

[GM] 22:32:25
All in one utensil. So you start working the sharp edge against the… your restraints.

[Ink] 22:32:26
Gotcha.

[Ink] 22:32:31
Poor guy.

[GM] 22:32:33
Yeah. Um, okay. Um… Uh, Zeke and Murderbot catch up to the three guys.

[GM] 22:32:42
Hauling the stuff. Like, you half run through corridors, and then whenever you… hear someone coming down, you slow down, and then you speed back up, it's like…

[GM] 22:32:50
High schoolers running to the halls of high school. Um, you guys…

[GM] 22:32:57
See them going down a corridor, they haven't noticed you at all. Um… have a short bit of time to come up with a plan and ambush them before they actually reach the armory.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:11
Um. You take the middle one, I'll take the back one.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:20
And we will strike at the same time. If the first guy looks back, then I'll go after him, or you can… You can try and sneak up on him, too.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:31
How's that sound?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:31
All right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:36
Cool? Alright, let's do this.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:37
Cool.

[GM] 22:33:44
What do you do?

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:46
Um, I… Zeke is sneaking up undetected in front of the third guy, but he's gonna go for the guy in the middle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:55
And at the same time, I'm going for the most… the guy in the back.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:00
Are we trying to knock them out or murder them?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:03
I'm going to… you're gonna knock the middle guy out with the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:09
With the spanner, I'm going to… use my…

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:22
I'm gonna use my… Penknife?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:32
No, maybe not Penknife.

[GM] 22:34:35
As I say, you do a prison-style shanking, or what?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:38
I was gonna say Stem and his jugular, but that might be pretty bad.

[GM] 22:34:41
Yeah. I mean, you are… you are a murder bot, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:43
How about I come… can I co-. Yeah, that's true, but can I come up to him and put him in a chokehold and make him go to sleep?

[GM] 22:34:53
Sure. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:54
That's my… that's what I'll try and do. If not, then I'll just snap his neck.

[GM] 22:34:58
So… so, like… in order approaching, because they're just, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:58
If you make too much sound.

[GM] 22:35:04
Moving through the hallways? Like, are you gonna, like, fast walk up alongside them? Like… Okay, so Ziggs has, like, slightly faster…

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:08
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:13
Yeah, in his cloaked state.

[GM] 22:35:14
Fast walk than you.

[GM] 22:35:19
Okay. If there were… if Ink's tattletale was on the wall, you'd see this really, like.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:19
Perfectly.

[GM] 22:35:27
Murderbot kind of, like, fast… walking down the hallway to catch up to these people so you could instantly grab one and just, like, try to put them into a chokehold right away.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:37
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:35:38
Um… Do you happen to have any kind of combat training such that hand-to-hand.

[GM] 22:35:45
Combat would be a skill you would have?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:52
I definitely do not.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:55
I mean… No?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:57
Why do we have so few skills?

[GM] 22:36:01
If you're hyper-focused on the xeno esoterism, or something. Hand-to-hand combat is a skill. Do you have that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:04
Apparently.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:11
No… Wait, where is Handy Hat come at?

[GM] 22:36:13
Okay. It says it's an expert skill, a MySheet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:18
Oh, it's an expert skill. No, I only have… mathematics and mechanical repair.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:26
And first aid. I had first aid, so I… I would know where all the essential… an important, uh…

[GM] 22:36:26
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:35
Blood veins are.

[GM] 22:36:36
I can assure you that you know about as much about.

[GM] 22:36:40
Trying to put someone in a stranglehold and knock them out is me.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:45
Oh, man. And you know a lot, motherfucker!

[GM] 22:36:45
GM Green. Do I?

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:48
Yeah, you… you… you're an assassin, you kill people. You're a ninja.

[GM] 22:36:51
Mm-hmm. That's why I've run this… this D&D game that… Where we play pretend of doing these things.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:56
Yeah, exactly!

[GM] 22:37:04
Um, alright. Zeke, uh… Why don't you make a strength check with Advantage?

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:10
Actually, GM, then I'll probably… I'll use the penknife, because, I mean, I don't have… if I don't have the skills to do this, then I might as well stabby stab.

[GM] 22:37:19
Okay. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:20
With the penknife.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:23
Oh, jeez.

[GM] 22:37:27
Zeke. Zeke whacks a guy, and he screams, Ow! Oh, something… ow!

[Dex Miro] 22:37:28
Oh, dear.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:30
Oh my god.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:34
Oh my god! Oh, no!

[GM] 22:37:36
Uh, meanwhile, you run up with your penknife, um… make a speed check.

[GM] 22:37:42
Just a regular speed check.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:45
Let me check… regular… Ooh…

[GM] 22:37:48
Okay. Um, while everyone's looking at this guy who's screaming out, uh, you come up and just… just start stabbing one guy as a prison shanking, it's just…

[GM] 22:38:00
You know, maybe you get them in the neck, maybe, you know, just get them in the chest a bunch of times, but… Um… the, like, the guy who hasn't been hit or stabbed.

[GM] 22:38:11
Starts freaking out and says, oh shit! Oh, shit! And he, like, dives for one of the guns in one of the, uh… the… the… the barrels, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:18
Oh, fuck.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:21
Can I… can I dive at his legs and try to, like,

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:23
sort of trip tackling.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:25
Yeah, he is cloaked.

[GM] 22:38:27
Sure. Uh… Why don't we do a speed check on that?

[GM] 22:38:39
Okay. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:40
Why did you bring me?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:40
Oh, Jesus!

[GM] 22:38:47
Uh… Zeke…

[Dex Miro] 22:38:49
So it decrease your stress by too much.

[GM] 22:38:52
Yeah, by the way, every time you guys fail, you're supposed to be taking a stress.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:54
Oh, yeah, it's more stress.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:56
I haven't failed yet. I haven't failed yet.

[GM] 22:38:59
Um… So Zeke dives, uh, tripping the guy, but also having the guy sort of land on top of him, and he becomes uncloaked, and he loses the spanner.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:10
No, shh!

[GM] 22:39:10
It, like, slides underneath the cart.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:12
Sweet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:16
Alright, is my guy down?

[GM] 22:39:18
Your guy is, like, grabbing at his neck where blood's shooting out between his fingers.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:21
Alright, I go to the next guy. I go to the middle guy that was attempted to be knocked out, but he… I guess, is he dizzy? Is… Or did he miss… does he miss completely?

[GM] 22:39:30
He… he's, like, he's, like, holding his shoulder, uh, Zeke… Yeah, he… Zeke… Zeke missed his head, he hit the shoulder.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:33
Oh, he hit the shoulder? Alright, so he's kind of disabled.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:34
mildly sore.

[GM] 22:39:39
The white walls of the hallway look like a Jackson Pollock painting of red.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:42
Oh, perfect, I love it. The more… the more stress we give these guys, the better. I'm gonna go after him with my penknife.

[GM] 22:39:51
Okay…

[Dex Miro] 22:39:53
Wait, what? Wait, what happened to the other one? He's just on the floor now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:53
I am MurderBot! Which one? The second one?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:58
He's on… he's on top of me, I'm gonna start.

[GM] 22:39:59
He's on top of Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:00
Yeah, he's on top. I assumed that Zeke's gonna try and, like, go after the spanner with… against the guy or something like that. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh no, GM, never mind!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:40:02
Flailing about in the moment here.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:06
No, I mean, I'm at the one murder bot stabbed with a pet knife.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:09
Nevermind. GM, can I open up the bin with the guy who's the dying… And find a gun, and, like, pick up a gun.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:19
Yeah, that's what I'll do. Well, no, I mean, just the fear of the gun. They don't know I can't shoot it.

[GM] 22:40:19
Yeah. All right.

[Ink] 22:40:22
Because that's always a good idea for us.

[Ink] 22:40:28
Zeke wanted to live past today.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:31
Zeke wanted to live past today. Zeke's not gonna get shot at, I'm just gonna threaten them, because I… they just saw me fucking take out a guy, and I'm bloody.

[Ink] 22:40:37
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:38
They're gonna listen to what I say. That's my… that's my thinking. Unless these guys are, like…

[GM] 22:40:41
Alright. I'm rolling it…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:45
Trained solder car or something. I don't fucking think they're gonna… they're gonna… they're gonna, uh, put up a fight, so…

[GM] 22:40:52
Uh, so I assume the most prevalent type of weapon, uh, amidst the group was an SMG or a pulse rifle, and then the… so on a D6, we'll do… One is Carnax, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:59
Yeah, yep, yep.

[GM] 22:41:05
Assault, like, the massive rifle. Or, uh… And a 2-3 is an SMG, and it's…

[GM] 22:41:14
4 or 5 is a pulse rifle, and a 6, I think someone had a handgun, maybe?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:17
Sure. Sure, whatever, whatever in there. Let's, let's just… pickup guns.

[GM] 22:41:19
Yeah. Alright, it's a pulse rifle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:24
Pulse driver, pick up the pulse rifle. Everybody freeze!

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:30
Get up and move over to the side! Zeke, find something in here to time up. Do they comply, or did they resist, or start running, or something?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:41:41
Importantly, is there's still someone on top of me.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:41
What did they do? Yes, I mean, I'm telling them to get off of him, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:48
I'm telling him to get off of you, and move over to the side.

[GM] 22:41:53
Yeah, this is sufficiently intimidating enough that they… they both back up away from.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:58
I start licking my… I start licking my fingers, I'm so good.

[GM] 22:41:58
The carts.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:04
That's messed up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:05
I'm kidding! I'm not doing that.

[GM] 22:42:06
Um… I mean, they're like, what's… what's wrong with that… that Murderbots command module?

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:14
What command module. Not of me.

[GM] 22:42:16
One that's installed in every one of your kind. You're not supposed to be doing this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:22
Not in me. You shut your mouth before I shh…

[GM] 22:42:24
You're gonna get reported for this. They'll probably… they'll probably just… they'll probably dismantle you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:29
Riddle you full of bullets. Did you not just see what I did to that guy?

[GM] 22:42:31
You can't hurt us.

[GM] 22:42:35
Yeah, they're like, okay, yeah, you're right, you couldn't hurt us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:41
Zeke, find a weapon, and find something to tie these guys up with.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:45
I do that.

[GM] 22:42:48
Um… There's nothing to tie them up with.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:52
Fuck.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:53
I had duct tape on me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:55
Maybe it's in the bin?

[GM] 22:42:57
No, they still have duct tape on you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:58
Oh, you have duct tape on you, then duct tape them up.

[GM] 22:43:02
Right, you have duct tape. You duct tape them up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:04
Uh, we… we throw the… one of the… the… we… we… Consolidate all the guns in one bin.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:12
And throw the dead guy in another bin, and the other two in the… in the… can they fit in the bins?

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:19
Oh, they're not… it's not… those aren't… it isn't that big.

[GM] 22:43:19
No, they can't fit in the bins. Also, you guys have too many weapons, they won't all fit in one bin.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:27
Oh, okay. Never mind. Um… They didn't really think this through, did we, Zeke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:43:35
Um, no. Nope.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:40
How many people… how many people at the Armory, uh, armory doors?

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:45
Or the Armory, um, entrance.

[GM] 22:43:50
Uh, you would know that the armory, which is adjacent to the brig, which is adjacent to security, has, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:51
Oh, I would know this stuff.

[GM] 22:43:55
A good 40 or 50 people around. Any one time, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:01
Oh, fuck me, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:05
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:12
What should we do?

[Dex Miro] 22:44:13
Did Murderbot kill the one he stabbed with a penknife, or is it just… he's very dead?

[GM] 22:44:15
Oh yeah, that guy stopped… Yeah, he stopped writhing around on the ground after a little bit.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:18
Okay. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:44:22
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:44:25
I don't know, is there, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:26
How far are we from the ship?

[GM] 22:44:29
Uh… I mean, by a full sprint, probably only… Um… 5 minutes?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:44:37
I mean, we're gonna notice us carrying these, these, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:37
Oh, God.

[GM] 22:44:37
At most.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:44:40
Tied up guards.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:44:43
Is there a bathroom nearby?

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:43
Uh, GM, that's officially not, uh, tied up, right? I would like to try and knock them out with the spanner.

[GM] 22:44:46
Yeah, there's bathrooms on every floor.

[GM] 22:44:50
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:54
Or with the SMG, whatever, blunt. Blunt… Blunt strike to the head, both of them.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:01
This seems like a terrible idea.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:04
Well, they're tied up! I mean, it's like shooting fish in a barrel, right? Come on, it can't be that hard.

[GM] 22:45:04
Just hold still. No, no, it's more of the, I'm gonna try and knock them out and not murder them part. That's the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:13
Oh, I don't care if I don't murder them. I… at this point, I just can't have them yelling and shouting or something like that, so I'm just gonna try and mobilize them.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:13
Yeah, exactly.

[GM] 22:45:15
I'm gonna…

[GM] 22:45:22
Alright, Zeke, you watch as Murderbot takes the spanner and… cracks these two guys on the head, just one after the other, and just sickening crunches, just crunch.

[GM] 22:45:32
Crunch. Uh… one kind of, like, spasms.

[GM] 22:45:38
As… after he's been hit, it just kind of flops around with his restraints.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:44
Alright, well, they're both dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:45:45
Zeke feels disturbed.

[GM] 22:45:47
That's quite disturbing. Murderbot is… demonstrated his name quite well in the last few moments.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:55
So they're very dead.

[GM] 22:45:57
Um, one of them… maybe two or not? Who knows? Murderbot doesn't do medicine on enemies.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:01
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:07
So, I was watching the videos. What'd you say?

[GM] 22:46:08
You just…

[GM] 22:46:13
I said, Murderbot doesn't do medicine on enemies.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:16
No. They are undeserving of our care. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:23
Okay, well, we're gonna have to either drag these bodies and… is there, like, another room nearby that seems empty or anything like that, GM?

[GM] 22:46:35
Um… yeah, there's probably, like, a janitorial closet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:39
We dumped these bodies in a janitorial closet. And with the janitorial.

[GM] 22:46:42
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:44
Oh, the janitorial materials, we clean up. The hallway as best as we can.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:52
To make it not look like a Jackson Pollett painting, and I tried to wipe my face off.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:57
And my clothes off as best I can. I understand that might take longer than…

[GM] 22:47:05
Yeah, the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:06
The speed at which I activate and move, but… does what we can do.

[GM] 22:47:11
All right. Back to… back to ink and the…

[GM] 22:47:17
The, um… bed bay. Cut through… you've cut through one of your strains.

[Ink] 22:47:19
Well, that's me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:20
MotorBox, where are you?

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:23
I'm right here.

[Ink] 22:47:30
I gotta cut through my strengths, and I have a nurse and a doctor sitting there still. They're not watching me.

[GM] 22:47:34
Yeah, they're not watching you, they're, like, in the other room.

[Ink] 22:47:38
Do I think I can sneak out?

[GM] 22:47:41
Yeah, there's a chance.

[Ink] 22:47:45
Okay, um… What check would I use for sneak out?

[GM] 22:47:51
You just have to probably, uh, move fast enough, so it's probably speed.

[Ink] 22:47:54
Ooh, you know what my highest skill is? That's speed. Let's do it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:55
You need to move quickly. The situation is getting worse.

[GM] 22:47:58
Alright, you're… you, like, peer out from around the, like. Curtain, or wall, or… I mean, it's not like a locked room or anything, it's just like a…

[GM] 22:48:08
You know, kind of like an ER-type situation. So you kind of peer out, you see the… The doctor and the nurse, they're, you know.

[GM] 22:48:15
There's no other attendees, or there's no other, um, patients in here, so they're just attending to, like, paperwork and stuff.

[GM] 22:48:22
Um, and you wait for your opportune moment to, like. Quickly move through the room to get to the exit.

[Ink] 22:48:29
Okay, can I have my, um… VoxBox ready to run, can it project, like, a voice somewhere else to distract them if I wanted to?

[GM] 22:48:39
I don't know. Does it…

[Ink] 22:48:41
Can perfectly mimic any voice after 10 minutes of speaking at Target stores up to 3 voices.

[Ink] 22:48:45
But the voices always sound like they're coming out of me.

[GM] 22:48:47
Yeah, I think that's more likely.

[Ink] 22:48:50
Okay. Uh, that probably won't work very well then. Okay, cool. Alright, so I'm gonna do my speed check.

[GM] 22:48:57
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 22:49:03
Oh, double… I just trip and fall on my face.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:07
Oh, no.

[Ink] 22:49:11
But can I… can I be talking in the CEO's voice?

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:12
Oh, no.

[GM] 22:49:21
Apparently, the, uh, sodium… whatever, uh… the true serumism.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:26
Pentethyl.

[GM] 22:49:29
Really gotten out of your system yet. You walk out into the middle of the room, he turns looking at me, just start talking to him about…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:49:37
I'm trying to escape!

[GM] 22:49:40
You're like, you can't see me, I'm moving here. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:49:41
Don't mind me!

[GM] 22:49:50
Yeah, yeah, you're definitely using one of your other voices for this moment.

[GM] 22:49:58
The doctor… doctor and nurse are startled. They, like, jump up, and they're like.

[GM] 22:50:01
Kind of frozen for a second. They're like, what… Like, what do they do? They… they're confused.

[GM] 22:50:09
Um… the… the doctor kind of says, you should probably go and lay back down.

[Ink] 22:50:19
Um, I'll lower my head and just walk back over there and lay down.

[Ink] 22:50:26
Muttering about how my parents didn't love me. And neither does he.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:30
Uh-huh!

[Ink] 22:50:34
Just like my father. All I wanted my harmonica.

[GM] 22:50:40
The… the nurse brings you a pillow. And, uh, and meanwhile, the doctor, like, goes back to try and.

[GM] 22:50:48
Like, restrain you and replaces the, uh… the… the broken strap.

[GM] 22:50:54
Um, he's like… the, you know, this is for your own… your own safety. We don't want you to get hurt.

[GM] 22:51:01
Uh, can you tell me where the sharp object is that you had, that you cut through this restraint with?

[Ink] 22:51:07
Only if you give me more apple juice.

[GM] 22:51:09
Okay, I can do that. The nurse is gonna just stay here with you, and just, you know, pat your head while I go get you more apple juice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:20
Just… resist!

[Ink] 22:51:22
Um, can I go like this? I want to tell you, Secret Nurse.

[GM] 22:51:27
Shit. She says, sure, and she, like, leans in real close.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:28
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

[Ink] 22:51:32
And I bite her in the neck!

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:34
Oh, no! What's happening here?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:39
We have just turned into a group of fucking… Just… monsters!

[Ink] 22:51:48
We're trying… we're trying to fight for our lives! Yeah, I got… I got fangs that do, uh… let's see what my fangs do?

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:03
Oh, man…

[GM] 22:52:06
He's a vampire!

[Ink] 22:52:08
They're, uh, poison fangs with… they do 2D10 damage.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:08
Man, we…

[GM] 22:52:14
She's… she's just a nurse. You… you… you latch on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:17
GM, I think we've lost the narrative here.

[GM] 22:52:25
This… this mothership, the horror is you guys…

[Dex Miro] 22:52:28
Yeah, I know, right?

[Ink] 22:52:30
I mean, we've seen some things, come on!

[GM] 22:52:38
Um, yeah, she… you… you… you get her right in the neck, and she… she goes to scream, but she passes out from.

[GM] 22:52:45
Blood loss and or poison, or whatever. She's… she's down on the ground.

[GM] 22:52:51
Um, you still have a hand free on account of having a broken strap, and you're easily able to get out of your restraints.

[Ink] 22:52:57
Okay, on to the strengths, and uh, I'm gonna make my way towards the door again.

[GM] 22:53:01
Okay. No, you just make it to the…

[Ink] 22:53:04
Did I have to roll a speed check?

[Ink] 22:53:10
Oh man, my stress is at 5, I gotta take it up a notch.

[GM] 22:53:17
Um, which, which direction are you headed? Yeah.

[Ink] 22:53:20
I'm out the door. Um, I guess I'm gonna head towards the ship.

[GM] 22:53:27
Okay. Uh, as you're sort of hurrying through the hallways, like, as you get, like, to the first intersection here, behind you, like, oh my god, Jesus Christ!

[GM] 22:53:36
Uh, do you assume the doctor found the body, he must have been just, like, in another part of the room.

[GM] 22:53:41
Getting some more sodium, or whatever. I don't know, he was getting you something, maybe it was apple juice, actually, but who knows?

[GM] 22:53:48
Um, so you start to hurry even faster through the hallways.

[Ink] 22:53:51
Okay, I don't… I'm still not doing a speed check, though.

[GM] 22:53:54
No, that's fine.

[Ink] 22:53:57
I mean, I got a 48 with speed check, too. I almost have a 50% chance of succeeding.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:54:03
The business…

[GM] 22:54:06
Um… Alright, uh…

[GM] 22:54:10
So, did Zeke and Murderbot take one VIN? I don't…

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:16
No, um… What do we do? We… we were… we put the… put the bodies in the closet.

[GM] 22:54:24
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:24
And we took one of the… we tried to fill one of the boxes full of as many guns, uh, taking care of the… put a Carnax, uh, baby into… into that box.

[GM] 22:54:36
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:37
And I guess the other two boxes we… left with the… Um, bodies.

[GM] 22:54:43
Sure. But it's primarily filled with weapons.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:48
Yes.

[GM] 22:54:49
Okay. And then are you heading back to… The ship heading back to the… the brig, or where everyone's held.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:59
Um, I ask… I asked Zeke, what, do we need to go and pick up… we need to go find those guys, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:08
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:11
Um, how heavy was the… security. Bet you saw.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:16
I don't know how Harvey was the security, I saw, like…

[GM] 22:55:19
Probably 4… 4 guards.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:20
And pole guards? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:22
Organized, I mean, we just took out 3 people. Um, by ourselves, so… where they aren't?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:26
Randy, yeah. Um, yes?

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:29
Oh, heavily armed. Okay, well, how about this?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:30
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:35
Um, actually, is there a… Um… is there… is there a terminal nearby, GM?

[GM] 22:55:44
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:47
Um, do we have a map of the… of the layout of the ship, of where we are?

[GM] 22:55:52
You guys have spent quite a bit of time on this ship, so you know the layout.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:55
Okay, so I wanna… what I wanna do is I wanna hack into the terminal and try and make it sound like there's a… an alert on the opposite side of the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:10
Of where the… like, I want to draw, you know. The guards and stuff away from the brig.

[GM] 22:56:17
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:17
To say there's, like, maybe, like, a fire on the opposite side of the ship.

[GM] 22:56:22
Uh-huh.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:24
Um… is that something I can do with this hack?

[GM] 22:56:27
Yeah, except for if someone beats you to it, there's an alert going off in the medbay right now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:32
Oh, fuck it. How about… I would like to suppress that mid-B.

[GM] 22:56:33
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

[GM] 22:56:39
It is in the opposite direction of the… The brig.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:43
Oh… What the fuck is going on in the medbay?

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:48
Wait, so I don't know what's going on, right? Obviously. Like, I don't know… No, no, no, no, sorry, I don't know where… no, no, I'm talking as Murderbot.

[GM] 22:56:52
Yeah, even Murderbot doesn't know what's going on.

[Ink] 22:56:56
You don't want to know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:59
As I'm hacking, what the fuck is going on in the medbay? But Murderbot does not know that Ink is over there, right?

[GM] 22:57:06
Now let's Zeke has told him that. Zeke knows that, essentially, uh, ink was being taken to the MedBay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:09
But Zeke doesn't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:14
Oh, there's some… okay, so I talked to myself, what the hell's going on in the medbay? And hopefully, did Zeke pick up on that when I said that?

[GM] 22:57:15
That's how he escaped out of the brig.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:25
Yes, I think, I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:25
Okay, Zeke, what's… is something going on in MedBay?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:29
Um, uh, honestly, I'm surprised, given how much vomiting there was, but, you know…

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:33
Who's in the medbay? Ink and only ink?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:35
Inc.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:38
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:40
Oh, okay, hmm. That means the brig is open, though. Well, no, I mean, less occupied.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:44
I don't think it's open.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:49
less occupied, yes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:50
Let's go then break out, uh… Carnoc and… Dex. Dex, what's your name?

[GM] 22:58:00
Karnak and Freder in the bed.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:01
Wait, how does…

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:05
Alright, I can. Decks, cardiac and Dex. Let's go break Carnec and Dex out.

[GM] 22:58:09
Dex.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:58:13
Let's do it.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:14
How did… how did Zeke know what was happening with ink?

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:14
Um…

[GM] 22:58:17
Because that's how he got out of the, uh… of the brig as he followed the two guards out, and the guards were taking…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:21
Oh. Right, but he doesn't know what happened in the Med Bay, he just knows how they got it.

[GM] 22:58:23
You know, they're probably like… He just knows that that's where ink was, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:58:24
Yeah, I am happy with the Red Bank.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:26
Yeah, yeah, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:30
Okay, that's what we're headed towards.

[GM] 22:58:34
Okay. Uh, you get to the brig. Outside, you see two guards standing at attention.

[GM] 22:58:40
Um. They each have a sidearm.

[GM] 22:58:45
But it's not drawn, they're not like… aware.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:46
Gosh, shh… Like, right. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:53
Um… I would like to use Foxbox.

[GM] 22:58:58
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:59
And make it sound like… There is a woman in distress.

[GM] 22:59:06
At your location. Can you throw your voice? I thought we just covered this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:08
No. Yes. Can't I?

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:13
Oh, no, I can't. Can perfectly mimic any voice after 10 minutes of speaking to the target.

[Ink] 22:59:14
He can, because he's an android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:21
Stores up to 3 voices.

[GM] 22:59:22
Well, apparently you have a woman's voice stored for some reason.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:26
Oh, no, I have, uh, I have, I have, uh, uh, Zeke's voice.

[GM] 22:59:27
Um…

[GM] 22:59:33
Is that the woman's voice, or is that Zach's voice?

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:34
Sorry, no, I was Zeke, I've gotta mimic Zeke's voice. Hopefully these guys remember what Zeke sounded like when they… When they picked him up. Zeke, I want you to cloak.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:43
And go down… And try and spring the other two.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:49
Um… if Zeke carries the box with him, is it cloaked as well, or no?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:59:54
Wait, what is our plan here?

[GM] 22:59:55
The box is on, like, a cart, it's far too big to cloak.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:58
Uh, it's far too big to cook, I see. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:05
Is there a way where… I can… as I'm…

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:10
Talking and walking away. Um, like…

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:17
No, I don't know how… how do we do this? How about we, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:35
The problem is, is Zika's not good at combat whatsoever. We do have guns, though. We do have guns, so we can ambush them. How about… how about I mimic my, uh, Zeke's voice, and like…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:00:39
I might be able to sneak a keycard.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:47
Guys, I'm, uh… what do we do here? Let's say, uh, oh, I tripped over and broke my leg, I'm sorry for trying to escape, please come help me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:59
And we'll… Zeke and I will both have, uh… rifles pointed at them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:08
Um… Um, as they turned the corner, and we'll tell them to put your hands up and.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:14
Slide your weapons over. I don't know, that's my plan. What do you think, Zeke? Do you have a better plan?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:01:24
Um, I thought I could cloak, try to swipe a keycard,

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:01:27
And if they catch me, I can run around the corner where you're waiting with a gun.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:31
Ooh, that's a good one, too. I like that. Smart.

[GM] 23:01:40
That's what you're going with?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:01:42
Either one's fine.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:46
Let's do Zeitz. Maybe that was a bad idea. But!

[GM] 23:01:47
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:52
Whatever.

[GM] 23:02:13
Alright, you… Cloak. You go up to the guards.

[GM] 23:02:20
The key cards are obvious, they're on, like, one of those, like, retractable… things, um…

[GM] 23:02:29
So, you're not sure if you're gonna be able to get it away from them unless you can cut the… the… little retractable piece, or you could just try to open, like…

[GM] 23:02:41
Pull the keycard enough to be able to open up the door.

[GM] 23:02:44
Um, one is standing close enough to be able to do that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:02:47
I was able to pull out my old utility knife from the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:02:50
bucket, barrel?

[GM] 23:02:55
Um…

[GM] 23:03:00
If you forego any other weapons, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:03
Uh, forego any other weapons. So I still have the one rifle, or… you mean…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:08
not… I don't even have that.

[GM] 23:03:10
I mean, you don't have that. You were, like, too obsessed with figuring out what… where your utility knife was to get anything else.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:15
Okay. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:19
I mean, not that I could really use either of them. If one's close enough, I'll just try to…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:23
I guess, move it towards the door.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:26
That's easier anyway.

[GM] 23:03:26
Okay. Alright, um…

[GM] 23:03:40
I'll leave it to you, whether you do… make a speed check or an intellect checked.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:44
I think I'm probably much better with intellect, let's see.

[GM] 23:03:48
Um, speeds, like, as if you just try to get it up there close enough, basically alerting them.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:48
Yes.

[GM] 23:03:54
Intellect's, like, waiting until they're distracted.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:57
Oh, so that's…

[GM] 23:04:00
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:04:02
First success of the day.

[GM] 23:04:06
Um, the guards, while at attention, at times, will fidget. Talk to each other. They're not, you know…

[GM] 23:04:13
100% bought in, so you wait till the… An opportune moment where, like, one is distracted.

[GM] 23:04:19
In a meaningful way, where you can get the thing up.

[GM] 23:04:22
Uh, the unfortunate part is that it does beep when you, uh… When you swipe it, um, and they're like, what? What the hell? Um…

[GM] 23:04:33
On the other side, Carnoc and, um… Ducks, you can hear the doors unlocked.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:04:41
Nice!

[Dex Miro] 23:04:47
But we were just, like, sitting in the chairs, we didn't expect the door to open, right?

[GM] 23:04:52
Uh, the door doesn't open, per se. Uh, if you were to approach the door, the door would open.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:57
Okay, so we just… we also heard the beep.

[GM] 23:05:00
Yes. You know, the door that Star Trek doors make? The noise?

[Dex Miro] 23:05:06
Yeah.

[GM] 23:05:07
Yeah, that makes that noise.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:17
Alright, I guess I would… Probably just roamed over the door and listened to what's going on on the other side.

[GM] 23:05:25
Alright, you go up to the door, the door opens, and then there's two guards there, and they're looking bewildered as to the noise.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:29
Huh. Nice.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:34
The noise? Oh, the bleep, yeah.

[GM] 23:05:36
Of the keycard being swiped.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:40
It's time to try to hit one in the back of the head again with my gun.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:44
Oh, dear God.

[GM] 23:05:48
Alright, make a strength check. With advantage.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:50
There we go.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:52
Here we go.

[GM] 23:05:56
All right. Yeah, he goes, owl! Owl! Ow, I've been… oh, what happened?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:59
Oh…

[Dex Miro] 23:06:05
Does Dex even know that Zeke has a cloak? Oh yeah, we saw you leave the room, yeah, okay.

[GM] 23:06:09
Uh, yeah, he knows, because… You sound, yeah, disappear and leave the room.

[GM] 23:06:16
Um, yeah, the guys stand there. The other one reaches for his gun.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:24
Did Carnoc follow me, or is he just sitting at the table still?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:06:26
Yeah. I'll follow you.

[GM] 23:06:31
Hey guys, Russian the guy with the gun? Are you just gonna… what's the… what's your… Let's remove.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:37
So I assume the one that got hit isn't really doing much actively other than… freaking out.

[GM] 23:06:43
I mean, he's also reaching for his gun, but not as quickly, because he's been hit in the shoulder.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:50
Alright, maybe I'll go after the surprised one and let Karnak get the less surprised one.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:56
Murderbot, where are you?

[Dex Miro] 23:06:58
I'm just gonna try to tackle him. And prevent him from using his gun.

[GM] 23:07:01
Okay. Okay. Um…

[GM] 23:07:11
You run up and…

[Dex Miro] 23:07:11
Is that… Athletics, combat… I don't have any of these skills, it doesn't matter which one it is.

[GM] 23:07:17
Yeah, you run up and you… you tackle them, um… Preventing him from using his gun is another story. You're sort of wrestling with him as he's drawn out of its holster.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:27
Yeah.

[GM] 23:07:31
It's one of those tense moments where it's like… Is the gun pointing at you, or is the gun pointing at him?

[GM] 23:07:39
Um, Carnoc, what are you doing?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:07:41
You know, run out, do the same thing, tackle the other guy.

[GM] 23:07:45
Okay. Uh, now you're a bit more of a physically intimidating specimen, so it's, you know…

[GM] 23:07:53
With him being injured, you have a much better chance of succeeding it.

[GM] 23:07:57
Getting his own gun away from him. Um…

[GM] 23:08:02
Okay. What is Zeke doing?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:08
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:09
I'm gonna…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:12
Can I easily signal to Murderbot?

[GM] 23:08:15
You're invisible, so now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:17
Um, okay, yeah, that's true.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:19
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:08:21
Is shouting really a problem now that everybody knows what the hell's happening anyways?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:28
I don't know, I'll help one of them. Who needs… who looks like they need more help?

[GM] 23:08:34
Dex needs more help, then. Than Karnak.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:35
Alright, I'll try to… I'll try to…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:37
pile on this guy that decks has taken.

[Dex Miro] 23:08:40
Are you gonna try to whack him with a spanner and accidentally hit me?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:43
Uh… I'll try to just, like, hold him so you can do something, I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:08:49
We'll just don't get shot by his gun.

[GM] 23:08:52
All right. Myrtabot, you hear, uh… wrestling in the hallway.

[GM] 23:08:59
Um, obviously signs of scuffle. Are happening.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:00
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:05
Um… I turned the corner with.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:11
The… with my gun drawn. And what do I see?

[GM] 23:09:14
You see Karnak… on top of one guy who, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:18
Uh-huh.

[GM] 23:09:20
He's got kind of, like, the arm with the… the weapon in it pinned to the ground.

[GM] 23:09:26
Uh, meanwhile, you see, um… decks on top of another guy, but there's, like, clearly a much more defined struggle going on, and it also seems like.

[GM] 23:09:36
There's maybe some other force involved, where… like, it's pulling at the guy's hair or something?

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:44
Okay. Uh, I'd say, um… U-guards…

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:55
Uh, stop resisting, or else I'm gonna shoot you and drop your weapons.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:00
Do they comply?

[GM] 23:10:02
No, because they feel like they, you know… the… you're… Your friends are in between you and the weapons.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:06
Do they have a shot at this?

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:12
Okay, then I go up to the one that looks like it's winning.

[GM] 23:10:17
Okay. With your gun this time, or with the spanner?

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:18
And I bashed his head.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:23
Yeah, with a gun, with the butt of the gun. With the butt of the rifle.

[GM] 23:10:26
Okay. Um… Okay.

[GM] 23:10:33
Uh…

[GM] 23:10:38
Make a… make a strength check with Advantage.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:48
Modifier?

[GM] 23:10:50
No. All right. You, you knock them out cold, and it's an impressive maneuver such that the other guy, um…

[GM] 23:10:59
Quickly complies, having seen. What just happened.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:05
Zeke, tie these fuckers up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:11:08
Done.

[GM] 23:11:10
Some duct tape comes out of nowhere. It appears…

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:13
Carnoc… Carnoc Deck's weapons are in the bin. Where is…

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:21
Ink? Where is ink?

[Ink] 23:11:27
Um, on the ship, I guess, by now, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:29
No, I'm not asking you, I'm asking them where you are.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:32
I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:33
You don't know? Well, there was a MedBay, uh, alert, so I suppose we should go that way to…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:11:34
I don't know, the guards took them away.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:42
To find him. Does that sound reasonable to you?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:11:46
Sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:49
I mean, it sounds perfectly reasonable to Dex, it sounds like a terrible idea to Dex.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:56
This… this is true. Well, I can hack into the terminal. What do you guys have?

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:01
We… we have control. We have our weapons, we have weapons back, Knock has his baby.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:06
Um, does anybody have any other things to hack into? I mean, I can try hacking in again.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:13
And then, you know. Try and get them away from… make an alert towards…

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:21
Some other area of the ship. To… so that we could go… go, uh, rescue Inc.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:28
What do you guys think? I'm open to ideas.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:37
Was ink the… was ink the one with the Lakilu? Can you send them a coded message, Murderbot, that he should go to the ship?

[Ink] 23:12:40
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:47
Yeah, I could do that.

[GM] 23:12:55
Um… Yeah, Ink Inc. Gets a transmission that.

[GM] 23:13:01
Indicates that everybody else has been freed, and that they're… headed to the ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:06
There we go.

[Ink] 23:13:07
Okay, so I feel pretty good about that. Have I made it to the ship?

[GM] 23:13:11
Uh… No, not yet.

[Ink] 23:13:16
Do I have to do a speed check?

[GM] 23:13:17
No, you don't have to do a speed check. Uh, but suddenly all the gravity on the ship turns off.

[Ink] 23:13:23
Oh, yes!

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:25
What the fuck?

[Dex Miro] 23:13:27
Wait, did you do that, Murderbud?

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:30
No? I don't know what's happening.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:13:33
So the gravity back to the end. Fix it, Virgo, bye.

[Ink] 23:13:37
You're the best, GM. I think, like, all the mean things I said about you being the most mean DM ever.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:45
I can try. I try to swim toward a terminal.

[GM] 23:13:49
It's awkward. You really wish you had training in zero-G.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:53
Oh!

[Ink] 23:13:54
Oh, yeah.

[GM] 23:14:01
You flounder around. And then bounce off the wall.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:03
I flounder around. Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:07
The fuck is happening!

[GM] 23:14:13
You suspect that the alarms that have gone up… this is some kind of weird.

[GM] 23:14:18
Protocol that they've implemented. To try and slow you down from doing whatever you need to do.

[GM] 23:14:25
A disorientation tactic.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:28
Um, I say to… I send another transmission out. Um, we are in… we are floating in the base.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:37
Come help! We don't know what's going on.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:38
All right. I'm gonna take the duct tape I have and…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:43
wrap it so, like, the sticky side is facing outside on my hands.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:49
And feet, and, like, stick to the ceiling.

[GM] 23:14:52
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:52
And start crawling.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:56
It's extremely slowly.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:02
Alright, um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:04
I'll throw it to anyone else who wants to follow me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:07
I'll do it. Send it over.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:08
Does that seem to be working?

[GM] 23:15:12
Uh, it is slow, um… But it is effective in terms of control.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:16
Dex has zero G training, is he good enough at this to try to… help somebody else get their bearings, or…

[GM] 23:15:26
Yeah, um… Yeah, so Zeke, like, throws the duct tape to Murderbot, but Murderbot's sort of doing, like, a cartwheel in the middle, like, the hallway.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:36
Whoa!

[GM] 23:15:38
The duct tape goes flying past him. So, yeah, Murderbot could use a little bit of help.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:41
Whoa!

[Dex Miro] 23:15:41
Well…

[Dex Miro] 23:15:46
Or can I at least try to stop Murderbot from spending.

[GM] 23:15:49
Yeah, you can get them to stop spinning.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:51
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:58
Alright, can I kind of, like… push them in the direction we want to go somehow, like, find something to…

[Dex Miro] 23:16:07
Wedge my foot into, or something. I don't know how well that would go.

[GM] 23:16:09
Yeah. You're used to doing, uh, ship repairs and things on zero-g, um… you're quite adept at finding the handholds that are necessary to keep moving.

[GM] 23:16:19
Most ships have some sort of design for an instance like this, where.

[GM] 23:16:24
There's enough, like, ridges and things to be able to, like, propel off of.

[GM] 23:16:29
Uh, they're not immediately obvious, though, for people who aren't used to this.

[GM] 23:16:35
Um, after a while, you show MurderBot how to do this himself, and… well, he still fumbles a couple of times, it's, you know, he eventually gets the hang of it.

[GM] 23:16:46
Um… Karnak, I assume, probably has some experience with doing, um…

[GM] 23:16:54
Some zero-tree training, and it kind of is, uh… marine background, so we'll assume that he can handle himself.

[GM] 23:17:01
And, um… On account of Dex's zero-G training, he's able to also hold the container with the weapons along as well.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:14
Great. Yes, it's easier to move heavy things right now, but…

[GM] 23:17:17
Um, you guys more… What's that?

[Dex Miro] 23:17:20
I guess it's easier to move heavy things right now.

[GM] 23:17:22
It's much easier to move heavy things, although… untrained, unskilled professional would… would have a real hard time trying to keep their own balance along with trialing something behind them.

[GM] 23:17:34
Um… What is this strength score?

[GM] 23:17:39
Oh, this was knocking the guy out. Okay. Um… Alright, you guys rendezvous with the ship?

[GM] 23:17:44
More or less at the same point. In time.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:56
Hey guys! Hey, hey, Inc.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:01
You okay? What the fuck?

[Ink] 23:18:03
Wipe the blood off my mouth. I'm great. I'm sorry that I wanted to put you in space.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:08
That was you! How did you do that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:18
Seems like our plans have been foiled.

[Ink] 23:18:22
Well, I think everything's going right as on schedule, isn't it?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:25
Is it? Okay. I don't know what's going on.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:18:27
Through cases delivered, we're on our ship, let's go!

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:32
I was in the ship. I'm just here to rescue.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:37
Are you ready to fly this thing, Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:39
I… oh yeah, that's right, I do fly this thing.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:43
Wait, did they refuel it already?

[GM] 23:18:46
Um… Hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:54
Roll it, roll it.

[GM] 23:19:00
Uh… okay. 1 in 10 chance they refueled your ship. 1 in 10, yeah, they didn't really have much of an intention of refilling their ship in the amount of time that you've been here.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:06
1 in 10.

[GM] 23:19:15
Um… So what number do you guys want on a one and done?

[Dex Miro] 23:19:15
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:19:23
One…

[GM] 23:19:24
1… Nope. There is… there is a smaller ship, uh, that's also in the bay, though.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:19:25
It's not a one.

[GM] 23:19:33
That likely, um… is fueled.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:35
Is Field.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:41
We take that trip instead, or, like, we… yeah, it still wouldn't be enough for us, because it's smaller, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:41
Alright, well…

[GM] 23:19:47
Well, here's an alternative. You don't need to actually do a jump.

[GM] 23:19:51
If you want to just use, uh, normal propulsion. To get there, um… Though you suspect that that might add a few years to your travel?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:02
But also, we're gonna have the company on our tail, aren't we?

[Dex Miro] 23:20:09
Well, that really depends on what Yandy does, doesn't it?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:13
Well, not just that, I mean, we just… I mean, we're a group that just kind of escaped from their…

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:20
And I don't know who did it, but… So, you know, one of you guys really murdered people, so I don't…

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:29
Fucking, you know, we're kind of fugitives on the run. Well, I don't know what happened, I don't know what's going on.

[Dex Miro] 23:20:33
I didn't murder anybody.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:20:38
Twitter one's a penknife.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:45
Um. So yeah, do we want to take the smaller…

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:50
One, or…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:20:53
Yeah. Although, I don't know, I don't want to share a cabin with anyone.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:20:58
Sounds… sounds cramped.

[Dex Miro] 23:20:58
You don't… you don't want to bulldot. Oh, yeah, I'm in the room.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:21:00
Nevermind.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:04
I mean, those are the smaller ship even have cryo bays, or whatever? Cryopods?

[GM] 23:21:09
Probably.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:13
Don't want to check out the smaller, smaller ship. I'm gonna go over there and open up the bay doors.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:20
Or are they already open, GM?

[GM] 23:21:23
Um… they… they are unlocked.

[GM] 23:21:27
But the computer doesn't mind flirting with you some more before you go.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:30
Oh, boy. I stick it in you.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:33
Can you keep other people out of the bay if anybody comes looking for us?

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:36
Oh, that too, and I'll lock all the other doors in coming to the bay, or incoming to the… And coming into the bay, yeah.

[GM] 23:21:47
It's a ra… it's a Raider. It has… 8 cryopods, crew capacity is 8.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:49
What does this ship look like? Does he have cryopods? For you guys?

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:58
There's a fueled! Alright, let's get into that one!

[GM] 23:21:58
Fuel capacity. It's fueled. Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:04
Wait, hold on! We need to double-check to see if it's, uh… do I have to go over there to see if it's bugged or anything like that, and remove any trackers or anything? Can we do that?

[GM] 23:22:12
Nope. Um… no trackers, no nothing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:14
No trackers? No nothing? Or can we… Alright, let's take this one and go!

[GM] 23:22:20
Okay. You guys load… Load onto the ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:22
Everybody agreed?

[GM] 23:22:26
Uh, bay door is open, as… Uh, you can… you can kind of see, uh, just barely through the glass of the door that there's a group of…

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:29
Oh, jeez.

[GM] 23:22:38
Of armed, uh… guards just at the door.

[GM] 23:22:42
Um… You swing the ship around and begin piloting it away from.

[GM] 23:22:50
Um… from the, uh…

[GM] 23:22:55
The main… Company ship.

[GM] 23:23:00
And then, uh… Murderbot, you get this sort of, like…

[GM] 23:23:06
Odd sensation, um… you feel…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:08
Uh-oh.

[GM] 23:23:13
Um, something in your body that you're not in quite control of?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:17
Just gonna explode.

[GM] 23:23:20
And, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:23
Guys, something's happening, something weird's happening! Oh, wait, are you guys in the… you guys are in the pods already, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:25
Throw them out the hat!

[GM] 23:23:29
They're not in the pods yet, no. No. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:30
Okay. Something's weird happening!

[Dex Miro] 23:23:30
I don't think so, no.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:35
My dongle's out!

[GM] 23:23:36
Uh…

[Dex Miro] 23:23:40
Oh, dear.

[GM] 23:23:43
As you're screaming at the entire ship begins to shudder and shake. It's like… quite violently, uh, you're worried in some ways that the ship might actually come apart.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:58
Oh, what? Oh, no…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:01
Wait, what? What do we think?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:05
There's something wrong with the ship, or Murderbots doing something?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:06
I don't know, are there any sensors, or does the company too cheap for that?

[GM] 23:24:09
Yep, yep, there's a lot of, like, flashing lights and warnings going off, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:14
Oh, no… I don't know!

[Dex Miro] 23:24:15
Okay. What is… what does all this stuff mean, Murderbad?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:24:20
Do they have tractor beams here?

[GM] 23:24:22
Uh, I don't actually think tractor beams are a thing, at least not on this ship or the company's ship.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:29
Aren't you a pilot shouldn't you know what all these displays mean?

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:31
GM, what are these things mean?

[GM] 23:24:34
Uh… There's a, um…

[GM] 23:24:44
Your navigational controls are off. And lost, meaning that, like… um… something is severely disrupted your…

[GM] 23:24:54
Both your flight path and your ability to, like, re-adjust to the flight path?

[GM] 23:25:00
Um… There's also an extreme.

[GM] 23:25:07
Heat warning, the, uh… There's a warning light that's going off about, like, the…

[GM] 23:25:13
Um, radiation levels on the, uh… And the ship's exterior are, um, flashing as they've increased significantly.

[Ink] 23:25:23
We're thinking that the bomb's going off in the suitcase? Are we gonna hit with a scionic attack?

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:31
Oh, that's what it is. That's probably what it is. We're getting hit by, uh…

[GM] 23:25:36
Um…

[Ink] 23:25:39
All right, I'm a jury rag in inverse psionic deflector field.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:39
We're getting… Okay, hit by an aspirinetic feedback loop.

[GM] 23:25:45
Alright, you guys put aluminum caps on your heads. Uh, to prevent any kind of attack.

[GM] 23:25:52
After, like, maybe a minute at most, uh, the alarms all subside.

[GM] 23:25:58
And the shaking and shielding of the… our, uh… shimming of the, uh, ship is… It has also subsided.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:07
How did that work out?

[GM] 23:26:12
Um, one of you goes over to, like, one of the… few windows on this ship, and the, uh…

[GM] 23:26:18
You can see that the… CEOship is no more.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:24
Whoa…

[Dex Miro] 23:26:25
The one we were on, or the CEO showed. Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

[GM] 23:26:26
The one that you were on, with the CEO.

[Ink] 23:26:30
Oh, but look, look, there's Carnoc's gun just floating out in space.

[GM] 23:26:34
It kind of got us going already.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:26:34
No, we brought a gun, yeah.

[Ink] 23:26:35
Oh, you gotta go, good, good.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:43
It's, like, very thoroughly destroyed, I assume.

[GM] 23:26:46
Yeah, uh, it also appears that any ships that were… close proximity. Uh, were also destroyed.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:26:54
Yeah, that's what they get for not paying my medical bills.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:54
Holy shit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:26:59
I want my Obamacare subsidy.

[GM] 23:27:02
Jesus. 750,000 people. Lost their lives, because…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:27:08
750,000 people!

[Dex Miro] 23:27:08
Wait, really? It was that big of a strip? Oh, okay. I see what you're saying.

[GM] 23:27:09
No, I'm making a reference to the government shutdown as to how many people will be without a job.

[Murderbot V2] 23:27:15
Yeah, they're not gonna get back pay for being furloughed.

[GM] 23:27:17
Yeah, that's the new thing they're trying out, right? They're like, it… there's no law that guarantees that you'll get back pay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:27:25
Oh, really? Conveniently… conveniently disappeared.

[GM] 23:27:26
Yeah. Even though… Even though, no, clearly, they put a law in place in, like, 2019 to make sure that people did get bad pay, but they're like, that law doesn't exist.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:28
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:27:37
Yeah, that doesn't exist.

[GM] 23:27:39
Neither does the CEO's ship anymore.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:27:43
Good time for me to go to bed.

[Murderbot V2] 23:27:44
Huzzah!

[Dex Miro] 23:27:46
So are we, like, in any danger from radiation?

[GM] 23:27:49
No. The… the… Um, yeah, this is… this is what we're gonna call it. You guys will pretty much make the… the journey back to…

[GM] 23:27:58
Yandy, unless you wanted to set course for somewhere else.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:01
Okay. Do we have any idea, like, how much the CEO was able to transmit about us?

[Dex Miro] 23:28:07
Before the trip blew up.

[GM] 23:28:09
Um, you suspect not very much on account of, uh, deep space communications are pretty… limited, um… They typically have it most, like, you know.

[Dex Miro] 23:28:17
Okay.

[GM] 23:28:22
Some… like… the data compression is such that, like, you can only transmit very small amounts of information very long distances.

[GM] 23:28:34
Um… So, at most, like, maybe… maybe they transmitted, like…

[GM] 23:28:40
A… written verb… like, a written description of you guys, like, has… is tall, has…

[GM] 23:28:46
Blonde hair, you know, like, like that, like, but no, like, um, pictures of you guys… Anything.

[Ink] 23:28:53
What kind of ship… what's our new ship type?

[GM] 23:28:56
Your new ship is a severe downgrade. It's a raider ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:59
Aww… But it's not.

[GM] 23:29:00
Which is… sounds cooler than it actually is.

[GM] 23:29:07
10.1, Raider. You also lost your APC.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:08
That's sucks.

[Ink] 23:29:13
Oh…

[GM] 23:29:14
And your, uh… Your drop… your drop ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:15
What's the APC again?

[Dex Miro] 23:29:18
The thing we were driving around on Samsung Dex ago. With the curse.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:21
Oh…

[GM] 23:29:34
Yeah, this ship sucks.

[GM] 23:29:42
Like, the… The escape pods are called Coffin Landers.

[GM] 23:29:46
Because you don't… you don't know if it's gonna be your coffin or not.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:47
The smell's terrible.

[Ink] 23:29:47
That's pretty good.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:50
Wow.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:57
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

[GM] 23:29:58
But… you guys survived. And you're on your way back for a nice, nice payday by… from Yandy.

[Ink] 23:30:08
We can buy a ship then.

[GM] 23:30:10
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:10
Yeah, we're gonna get paid…

[Dex Miro] 23:30:12
So the question is, do we need to, like, stay away from the company forever now?

[Ink] 23:30:16
Nah. I got his guy with blue hair, guy that loves Spanner.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:17
Yeah, probably.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:22
Right, but they might not have even had time to, like.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:26
Tell them… About all the stuff you said, I don't know.

[GM] 23:30:30
Who's… who's Desperado name is Spanner Lover? Okay, well, Spain.

[GM] 23:30:41
All right. That's… that's the end of the session.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:45
Huzzah!

[Ink] 23:30:47
Thank you, GM.

[GM] 23:30:49
Thanks for entering some horror elements into my horror game. I count on you guys being… just…

[GM] 23:30:56
Absolutely ruthless in your murder of people.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:56
Murder… larger bots…

[Ink] 23:31:00
I could not get the… I could not get the AI to let me bite her neck.

[Ink] 23:31:07
Instead, like, use the videos that I'm getting.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:11
Yeah, I'm kind of glad that Dex wasn't there for the home murder bot penknife incident, because that would leave me wondering about what was going on, so…

[Ink] 23:31:18
And I tell you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:18
Nobody knows.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:21
Yeah, missed all of the gruesome stuff that was going on, actually.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:26
Alright, GM, what was going on with me? And before the… the huge…

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:34
Blow up. Oh, it's an EMP.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:34
Your electronic component incidents and EMP-like thing, or whatever, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:40
That went off. Okay.
