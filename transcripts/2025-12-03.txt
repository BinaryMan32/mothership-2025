[GM] 21:52:19
But… I'm trying to look to see.

[GM] 21:52:23
Yeah, no, I was probably just… Roofing on her picture.

[Ink] 21:52:24
You have the problem.

[Ink] 21:52:31
Cool to see if, uh… what the AI… What the KMI got, based off of your description.

[GM] 21:52:32
Alright. How close it got.

[Ink] 21:52:39
Of looking at the picture, how that looks in?

[GM] 21:52:43
Like a sketch artist. Can you catch the criminal?

[Ink] 21:52:45
Yeah.

[GM] 21:52:48
Um… I think I probably am done trying to… basically, what I was doing that whole time was trying to.

[GM] 21:52:55
Copy pictures from… the book into… and upload them to… Um, which I'm gonna call it.

[GM] 21:53:03
this thing we use. Roll 20.

[GM] 21:53:07
Um… and so now… Got most…

[Ink] 21:53:10
Um, having report is, um, just a couple of, like, small scars, probably shrouded wounds of some sort, um, and she has, like.

[Ink] 21:53:16
A sort of deep, serious eyes.

[GM] 21:53:22
Yeah, that sounds about right.

[Ink] 21:53:24
Blonde hair, long above shoulder length.

[GM] 21:53:35
You're reading the transcript, I do say M a lot more than when I'm trying to riff.

[Ink] 21:53:39
I'm sure we all do, right? Yeah.

[GM] 21:53:42
Every almond is a brain processing unit. It's a token. It's a token. That's what it is.

[Ink] 21:53:45
Yeah. Well, it's funny, I was listening to an NPR thing that said, you don't necessarily want to take ums out of your, uh… your speech, because they.

[Ink] 21:53:58
They are cues for the listener. Um, as well, so they're not… they're not necessarily bad speech, if that makes sense.

[Ink] 21:54:05
Which I thought was good.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:11
That's interesting.

[GM] 21:54:14
Alright, let's start with this, then.

[Ink] 21:54:15
They, like, give you a cue that, hey, something that's coming up is gonna be… you're something you're gonna have to process a little bit more, and… Things like that.

[GM] 21:54:25
Oh, what layer am I at? I guess it doesn't matter.

[GM] 21:54:34
What? No, not breathe fire. They've updated.

[GM] 21:54:42
Roll… roll 20's got a little… It's got a little much going on with it right now.

[GM] 21:54:52
Same spot right, right there.

[GM] 21:54:57
shrink that down to that. Looks good.

[GM] 21:55:01
Alright, let's just…

[GM] 21:55:08
Hide this…

[GM] 21:55:16
Um, did everyone have a chance to catch themselves up on the… Previously on D&D.

[Ink] 21:55:25
If we're about to go into the deep.

[GM] 21:55:28
Remember why you're going into the deep?

[Ink] 21:55:30
Because the androids took it over, and uh… we need something from there. I forget what we need from there. Shoot.

[GM] 21:55:36
Yeah, what do you need?

[Ink] 21:55:38
A virus. An AI. Monarch.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:40
The economic problem.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:46
Monarch?

[Ink] 21:55:48
I think that's what it was called.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:53
Yeah, I mean, well, the Monarch is the name of the AI in charge of the station, but… We're just supposed to graph the economic model that the Androids developed.

[Ink] 21:55:57
Oh, not necessarily AI, they will do the economic protection.

[Ink] 21:56:03
Gotcha, and that's that. That's not necessary. So…

[Dex Miro] 21:56:06
bring us… I don't… I don't know why they do such a good job of making an economic model when they're not really involved with the economy.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:26
But it seemed like it's a weird situation to be in, because there… you can't really tell the difference between androids and people, like, the Cylons, so… I don't know if that means they can, like.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:38
Just snap their fingers and look like something else, or… Like, can they look like a human, or are they just indistinguishable from humans in general?

[Ink] 21:56:44
They're… they haven't been.

[Ink] 21:56:51
They have a manufacturing plant there, maybe, I guess, to… fabricate them, and…

[Dex Miro] 21:56:54
Yeah, I don't know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:56
They're not, like, shape shifters, presumably, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:00
Yeah, but it just seemed like nobody was allowed in or out of the station, because… They couldn't figure out who was humans and who was androids, so they… I didn't want to let anybody on or off.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:12
Do you think you could get on, just not off? They want Androids to get off.

[GM] 21:57:12
Um… Yeah.

[GM] 21:57:18
Yeah, Kilroy tells you that, um… She has seen it where.

[GM] 21:57:25
Um… members of our crew. are with her, like, when she was… did her tour on the… on the deep.

[GM] 21:57:35
Um, that she was… saw duplicates of people.

[GM] 21:57:41
it wasn't just… like, she never saw a duplicate of herself.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:43
Whoa.

[GM] 21:57:45
But… there… You know, people that she'd known for years and years.

[GM] 21:57:51
As part of her crew. That's something there'd be more than one of them.

[GM] 21:58:02
So, she doesn't know if, yeah, they're… taking on any kind of shape.

[GM] 21:58:09
Or… somehow they can just manufacture a clone of some kind real fast.

[GM] 21:58:14
How they figured that out, just… she doesn't know.

[GM] 21:58:18
Alright, let's see, you guys…

[Dex Miro] 21:58:21
Is there, like, some chip we could have gotten?

[Dex Miro] 21:58:24
button that could prove that we're else. that the Androids can copy.

[Ink] 21:58:28
Hmm.

[GM] 21:58:28
Um… tells you that the… most people have a token of some kind, some sort of… indicator, um… That helps them.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:41
Did the androids figure out how to copy the two?

[GM] 21:58:43
Well… It's important, like… Like, to keep that a secret.

[GM] 21:58:49
And, you know, make sure that there isn't, uh… You know, you tell somebody… Somehow that gets out.

[GM] 21:58:57
If you, uh, if the machines learn about it, then they can duplicate that as well.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:06
Gotcha, so it's not like a, let's just scan everybody's code when they get back on the ship sort of thing, yeah.

[GM] 21:59:11
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:11
Okay.

[Ink] 21:59:13
On the, uh… the androids can just… We all conveniently put USB ports on our side of our heads, didn't we, for the Androids to just download our brains and… Then, uh, change them to put them in their Android bodies.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:28
I guess we sort of do that. Maybe we shouldn't have gotten those mods.

[GM] 21:59:35
Oh, wow!

[Ink] 21:59:37
You know, you need, uh… we need the, uh, the virus, right? So that when the android goes to steal your brain, it, uh… We infect the android.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:49
Yeah, Zeke's good at that sort of thing, right?

[Ink] 21:59:51
Right? Zeke's definitely gonna upload himself all to the, uh… the entire US.

[Ink] 21:59:59
He's gonna take over mono.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:00
Gotta replace.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:03
put Zeke's consciousness into all the androids, yeah.

[Ink] 22:00:04
Exactly.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:05
Yeah.

[GM] 22:00:08
Um… So that's Kilroy on the bottom, she's not… Floating in the middle of space, it's just, like, where her picture was in relation to the upper part is.

[GM] 22:00:19
Um… a couple of ship… or the patrol ships, uh… And the… that's not all the scale, there's quite a bit of distance in between those ships and the deep.

[GM] 22:00:32
So… um… The actual size of the station is pretty significant, um, significantly larger than these ships.

[Ink] 22:00:42
Okay, and then now we know the name of that thing that's floating around there, the bell, we didn't know that before, right?

[GM] 22:00:47
Yeah, but she would have told you that, it's not secret information or anything.

[Ink] 22:00:52
And that's an engine that's been disconnected from the…

[GM] 22:00:57
Yeah. So, in order to just, like, make sure that the… what's going on on the station doesn't get out. They, um… basically… disabled its, uh, ability to… To drive itself.

[Ink] 22:01:12
And which ship are we on right now?

[GM] 22:01:14
Uh, your ship is not pictured, but you're docked with, um… I think the swing high.

[GM] 22:01:22
Is that right? Swing sheet, because that's the one that… Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you're the one, you're on whatever one she's on. What's she on?

[Ink] 22:01:26
Okay, the bigger one.

[GM] 22:01:31
No one says captain as Klaus Olham. Let me see… look it up.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:32
I thought it wasn't that one.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:36
I mean, they all have capital throughout her, but she's, like, the…

[GM] 22:01:42
Yeah, maybe she's just not the captain of the ship.

[GM] 22:01:52
Okay. She's just a commander.

[GM] 22:01:59
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:02:09
Okay, yeah, no, she's not the captain of the ship, so you guys are on the Zhuangzi.

[GM] 22:02:15
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:02:27
Are we supposed to know what Cloud Bank means, or…

[GM] 22:02:30
Club Inc is the name of the actual facility.

[GM] 22:02:34
The nickname of it, it's called The Deep. Because it's, like, going… the call… going on dives when, uh, they send.

[GM] 22:02:41
patrols in to see if they can't. Um… get some recon on it.

[GM] 22:02:48
So, she's commander of… What do they call her team?

[GM] 22:02:54
troubleshooters.

[Dex Miro] 22:03:05
Double.

[GM] 22:03:19
Um, did you guys tell her why you were here?

[Ink] 22:03:23
she kind of inferred that we were the next team, and we said, yeah.

[GM] 22:03:26
All right, because didn't you guys disguise yourselves at her… In some way, like… that you're a part of the company still?

[Ink] 22:03:33
Yeah, we're still… we have a company ship, and I don't think we said much more.

[Ink] 22:03:37
More than that. We just let her make the inference, we went along with it.

[GM] 22:03:48
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:03:54
Um, she asks what… Level of clearance you guys have been given.

[Ink] 22:04:08
Um, do we have any understanding of… clearance levels?

[GM] 22:04:11
You could just say, like, high or low. Like, low clearance would be, like, you don't know a lot, and high clearance would mean that you're… Fully informed on what's going on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:21
high clearance.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:24
Oh. Look…

[Ink] 22:04:24
But we don't know.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:26
I really should have asked, I guess more questions.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:27
Low clearance.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:32
We have high-low clearance.

[Ink] 22:04:34
Yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 22:04:40
I think it's… I think we're gonna have to just be honest, at low clearance, we haven't been given much information.

[GM] 22:04:45
Okay. So, what she wants you to do, then, as part… Part of your dive, she.

[Ink] 22:04:46
Well, you're gonna…

[GM] 22:04:55
Want you to install encrypted radio transmitters. This will give them better, uh… Better understanding of what the… Sort of day-to-day movements of the thing are, when there's not a team on board.

[GM] 22:05:11
Or should you guys get killed, you know, they can at least monitor things after… After you're dead. Um… Then she wants you to… Scout a secure location on floor 3.

[GM] 22:05:23
And with that, she pulls up a blueprint of… The ship… Um…

[GM] 22:05:37
I just reveal the whole area here.

[GM] 22:05:46
So this is the external… view of the Deep?

[GM] 22:05:54
Oh, Dex, were you asking

[GM] 22:05:58
with a company or something?

[Dex Miro] 22:06:01
Yeah, I just didn't know what it was. Was it… is it a company name?

[Dex Miro] 22:06:05
Or the station name, or…

[GM] 22:06:06
Yeah, it's like a subsidiary of the… actual company.

[GM] 22:06:14
So find a secure location on floor 3, so all these 3-point whatever are all floor 3.

[GM] 22:06:21
Um… to use as a forward operating base.

[GM] 22:06:26
And then, once you've been able to hold it for 1-5 hours.

[GM] 22:06:31
Um, make radio contact. And hopefully then, um, she'll send you.

[GM] 22:06:38
Uh, backup.

[GM] 22:06:41
Uh, and then… There's a… database that she wants you to download, but she'll send you instructions on… on that.

[GM] 22:06:51
Later. Um, but the database can be accessed on Floor 5.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:00
That says there's an AI core on floor 5.

[GM] 22:07:06
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:06
What does she know about that?

[GM] 22:07:10
Um, she knows that… the AI is hyper-intelligent.

[GM] 22:07:16
That's been running. Uh, she's worried that… Um… all the things that have gone wrong with the station are likely due to this AI.

[GM] 22:07:27
Um… what's its name?

[Ink] 22:07:31
That's monarch.

[GM] 22:07:36
Its name is Monarch.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:45
The database she wants us to download, we can get to.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:48
From the AI core on 4 or 5, or…

[GM] 22:07:50
Yep. Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:54
Oh, that's right, you said the tip.

[Ink] 22:07:57
human emulation app.

[GM] 22:08:07
And then she's like, okay, now let me give you a more detailed view of the station.

[GM] 22:08:12
And she, like… Pulls up… Uh… the… Map of the station…

[GM] 22:08:28
And… Let's see…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:41
Whoa.

[GM] 22:08:42
see what I have to deal with in running this thing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:44
Whoa. Whoa.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:47
What is this? These are all rooms.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:48
What the heck? This is like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:51
It was like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:54
Electric plans or something.

[GM] 22:08:57
Um… so in the center there, like, it shows you which ones are… the floors, and so they kind of.

[GM] 22:09:04
Um, correspond to… different regions. So the floor is 3.3, 3.7, whatever. Those all… correspond to the outer side thing, and this is, like, a room-to-room connection.

[GM] 22:09:15
Essentially.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:20
Great easy.

[GM] 22:09:21
She tells you this… this is, you know, it's taken many lives to be able to get.

[GM] 22:09:26
All of this information out of there.

[Ink] 22:09:30
Seems like they should have been able to just look at the blueprints of when they built the state.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:33
Many Bothans died.

[GM] 22:09:34
Yeah, but things have changed since then. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:09:36
Okay, the AIs have updated it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:37
giving us this information.

[GM] 22:09:47
So… However you want to approach it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:52
So, our main mission… our original mission, our deep cover mission, is that we're going in to steal this algorithm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:59
Right?

[GM] 22:10:00
Mm-hmm, yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:01
But this new mission that we're getting from

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:05
What's her face again?

[GM] 22:10:08
Rachel Kilroy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:08
Kilroy, right, is now… she wants us to plant the surveillance camera somewhere, or…?

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:14
What was it again? I don't… I should have been writing with, uh…

[Ink] 22:10:17
We call an encrypted radio transmitter for monitoring the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:18
Radio transmitter, sorry.

[GM] 22:10:18
Sure.

[Ink] 22:10:22
We need to… we need to hold floor. Or 3 for 1D5 hours, I think I guess GM's gotta roll that.

[Ink] 22:10:27
Uh, when do you roll that in? And then… Then he'll send this report.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:29
So we hold it…

[GM] 22:10:29
When you get there.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:32
Oh, that seems like a… Wow.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:37
Like, what's happening during those…

[Ink] 22:10:41
We're just proving that we can hold that… that position before we get reinforcements.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:44
The problem is, is how many…

[GM] 22:10:46
It's… it's essentially a rendezvous point for the… The, um, backup that she's gonna send.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:53
How many, uh… how many androids do we know are on this thing?

[Dex Miro] 22:10:54
Oh, she's sending in more back.

[Ink] 22:11:00
Lisa.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:00
Is there… do we have intel on that at all from them, or no?

[GM] 22:11:00
Um…

[GM] 22:11:05
Uh, she… she says there's… could be thousands, hundreds of thousands, she has no idea.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:10
Oh, they don't know.

[GM] 22:11:11
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:12
But it's overtaken by androids, and we can't let any of these androids out, because they all look like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:18
real people, right?

[GM] 22:11:21
Um… right. Can't let anybody off the station. Um… Sometimes… ships to, like, this place has gotten a reputation for having artifacts on it that people can… fetch hundreds, if not…

[GM] 22:11:35
Uh, millions of credits. Or, um, I should have said thousands, if not millions.

[GM] 22:11:40
Uh, so there are sometimes ships that get past the blockade and get onto there.

[GM] 22:11:46
Um, but anyone you meet, you should immediately assume.

[GM] 22:11:51
As an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:51
And Androids are…

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:54
automatically violent toward humans, or they…

[GM] 22:11:56
No, no. No. Some of them might even be helpful, but you can't… You know, don't… don't go finding sympathy for these things. They're all just machine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:56
Oh, no, that's not a thing, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:07
Right. And they will do what they can to try and get off this thing, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:12
Or if I… no, is that not, like, their…

[GM] 22:12:16
I don't know what their… what their end goal is.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:17
Okay, so we don't know what their intentions are, we just know that there's a whole shit ton of them, and they have… there's a blockade, uh, just to prevent some, uh, these guys…

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:27
From leaving.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:29
Now, do they… okay.

[GM] 22:12:30
Okay. I will be right back. Hold on, I'll be back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:40
I mean, I'm assuming they know that…

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:43
there is a… there's, like, a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:48
a plan to not let them leave, or something like that, that they're…

[Ink] 22:12:54
They've already tried to leave at some point. Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:55
Okay, and I'm sure that that information got back to…

[Ink] 22:12:59
We don't… well, they… they're… they're… I guess the same way that she sent people in that never come back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:00
Space Station or something?

[Ink] 22:13:04
they've sent people out, and they've never come back, so, right, they might… Yeah, they might look out there and see there's these ships, and they see that they're… they're androids don't ever come back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:06
Oh, so it's just a big black hole.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:11
Gotcha.

[Ink] 22:13:15
I mean, at minimum, right? Or they could have a lot more information, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:18
So, do we go in as, like, acting like androids, or do we go in being like, hey…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:24
We're from the outside, we want to help you get off this planet, or…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:28
what… what do you think is the best thing to do for… or how to get on? Like, do we go in there, try to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:35
feel out what the temperature is, or…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:38
Or should we go in with, like…

[Dex Miro] 22:13:39
I'm gonna know that we have any hope of pretending that we've been on the station the whole time and we're not actually scouting it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:45
Oh, we want to just, like, kind of, like, blend in. I put out… I mean, if everyone on Android, and they're all… I don't know if they're all hooked up to a network or something.

[Ink] 22:13:50
And then when they all end up looking… they all end up looking like you, maybe, you know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:54
Oh, that's true too. Oh, wait, so is there, like, a machine in their…

[Ink] 22:13:57
It's a whole ship full.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:59
producing these androids.

[Ink] 22:14:01
There's… there's supposed to be able to produce them there, right? And one of the things on… Not on the NBA as of now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:03
Okay, so they are…

[Ink] 22:14:06
But the other image had a human… population lab… oh, there was another thing that was… Talked about… about building.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:13
Gotcha. So there's a big…

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:15
There's a big machine that's just creating androids.

[Ink] 22:14:18
It's just… the whole cloud bank, it's a synthetics production facility.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:23
Oh, yeah, okay. So it's a… it's an Android-making machine.

[Ink] 22:14:24
It assumes that, yeah, originally was making. Yeah, like, a factory from… Making synthetics.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:32
Great.

[GM] 22:14:32
Alright, I'm back. Sorry to disrupt your flow, Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:35
Um, no, no, no flow.

[Ink] 22:14:41
Um, when we first came on the station, on the ship, she did something to try to detect if we were androids or not, right?

[GM] 22:14:47
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 22:14:48
Can you remind me what that was?

[GM] 22:14:51
Just kind of like a scanner.

[Ink] 22:14:55
Um, can we get one of those?

[GM] 22:14:58
Hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:05
Do they have the tech to be able to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:10
detect it, whether or not we are humans or we are…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:15
Androids.

[Ink] 22:15:15
Yeah, that's what I'm asking for right now, Murderbot. When we came on, they had a scanner that could detect.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:19
Or is it that we have enough gear on us that… are we considered?

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:25
I'm not, but… yeah.

[GM] 22:15:26
Jose, you've been modified so much that…

[Ink] 22:15:30
What did they think about Murderbot? your full synthetic, so what do they do to verify that he was.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:32
I'm an android. I'm one of them, right?

[GM] 22:15:36
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:15:40
I guess, safe.

[GM] 22:15:41
Well, that you guys didn't come from the deep.

[Ink] 22:15:44
Okay.

[GM] 22:15:44
Right. They're monitoring that space, so it wasn't… if you guys have been… coming the other direction, then they don't.

[GM] 22:15:50
Definitely would have killed Murderbot, because they're like. Not gonna take any chances.

[Ink] 22:15:52
Okay, how's… Are they gonna allow Murderbot to go with us? Because how do they verify Murderbot on the way back out?

[GM] 22:15:59
Well, they're just as worried about him as they are about all the rest of you. So you're saying, like, what if he gets replaced by a… another Android, because there'll be an Android for sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:02
Why are they worried about me?

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:05
Oh, by, uh, bye.

[Ink] 22:16:06
Well… We go in and we come back out, right? And they can scan us and see, okay, we're still not synthetics with her scanner, but scanning Murderbot now, he's synthetic and scanning him later, he's synthetic, so there's no way of knowing that Murderbot hasn't been compromised, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:08
Yeah…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:20
I mean, they could just, like, look on my butt, it's gotta have a serial number on it, right?

[Ink] 22:16:20
Other than doing… we could do a checksum on him, right?

[Ink] 22:16:27
We need to check some on your base operating system, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:30
I guess they could replicate my body with my serial number.

[Ink] 22:16:35
Well, they could upload new code into you, now you're…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:36
Oh, yeah, because I have a… I have a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:40
I have a USB slot into my neck.

[GM] 22:16:43
Yeah. So, like, you're probably right, we probably should just make a backup of his consciousness now, and just overwrite him when he gets back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:48
Oh, yeah, just…

[Ink] 22:16:51
Oh, wipe him, okay. That's… yeah. We can't just do, like, the sub-layers of his operating systems that are read-only, and uh… Make sure that those haven't been changed, so he can still retain his memory.

[GM] 22:16:52
It's probably the safest thing to do.

[GM] 22:17:03
Um… I mean… Yeah.

[Ink] 22:17:05
It's probably safer to wipe them, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:07
This would be like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:08
I have the plans to get to this one place that we all need to get to in the movie.

[Ink] 22:17:13
No, don't worry, Carnoc will fill you in on the dark things that you missed, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:13
But by accessing it,

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:17
But accessing it will wipe my memory forever, in essence, I will not remember who any of you are.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:29
Carnoc's like, okay.

[GM] 22:17:33
He says the word.

[Ink] 22:17:35
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:38
Which is…

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:40
Bumblebee, right, Carnoc?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:17:43
You want me to say it?

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:44
No!

[GM] 22:17:45
Okay. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:49
That's so funny. Like, he can't even whisper. I can't… I have to, like, find out, like, by hacking it or by looking it up somewhere. I can't even, like, hear it from somebody.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:00
He can't even… I can't even overhear him telling, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:03
Any of the other crew or asell blow up?

[Dex Miro] 22:18:15
it is, you're gonna say by mistake, so it's really better if you don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:17
Probably.

[Ink] 22:18:19
But Murderbot's saying it doesn't actually do it, right? It has to come from Carnoc.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:21
Oh, it has to be the voice of Carnoc saying it.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:24
Probably.

[Ink] 22:18:26
So, like, Carnoc could whisper to me, and then I could say it all day long, and it wouldn't do anything, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:27
To trigger it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:31
Unless I overhear the whisper of…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:34
Car not telling you.

[Ink] 22:18:34
Well, until one of us replicates Carnoc's voices with our voice… voice…

[Dex Miro] 22:18:37
Exactly, I was affected, yeah. I can't remember what that thing's called.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:42
But yeah.

[GM] 22:18:45
Um, she is able to provide you with a cybernetic diagnostic scanner.

[GM] 22:18:49
However, that being said, this thing is big and bulky.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:53
Oof. Jeez.

[GM] 22:18:53
It's like, uh… a whole, like, backpack's worth of, like… Thing. It's just, like, sits on your back.

[GM] 22:19:02
It's huge.

[Ink] 22:19:05
Alright. There you go, uh… We're about hearing… You're our mule.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:11
Why am I carrying it?

[Ink] 22:19:14
You're our mule, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:14
Thought of, uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:17
So that can tell us if somebody's on Android or not, or that can just verify murder bots?

[GM] 22:19:21
They can tell if a person is an android or not.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:21
Consciousness.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:23
GM, had Andrews tell other androids?

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:26
Or no.

[GM] 22:19:27
Only if you do the secret… plug-in thing. We plug in with each other.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:31
Oh. I see.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:33
Okay. There's no, like…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:36
Is that how Androids are looking at each other?

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:37
There's no, like, optical scanner implanted in me that can tell whether or not…

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:42
I can't x-ray, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:46
just beings on the fly, see if they're…

[GM] 22:19:51
No.

[Ink] 22:19:51
Some of us had potential updates for that, right?

[Ink] 22:19:55
But where's my spreadsheet?

[Dex Miro] 22:20:00
Well.

[Ink] 22:20:02
I thought we had…

[Ink] 22:20:08
Was that slickware, or was that…

[Ink] 22:20:12
So…

[Ink] 22:20:22
Oh, no, we just had something that could disable the Espernetic Feedback Loop, okay.

[Ink] 22:20:37
Loudmouth is the name of the thing that, uh… records playback audio.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:53
So, do we get to pick what spot we try to… To our insertion point

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:56
Land.

[GM] 22:20:57
Yes

[Ink] 22:21:00
What's her recommendation?

[GM] 22:21:03
Um, well, she tells you that the radio transmitter she wants you to install are on floors, too.

[GM] 22:21:11
3.1, 4, and 6.

[Dex Miro] 22:21:16
What? Like, that's where we're gonna install them, or that's where we have to get them?

[GM] 22:21:19
That's where you have to install them. Yep.

[Ink] 22:21:22
We have to install 4 of them for? Oh, wow, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:25
This biatch is getting muddy…

[Ink] 22:21:30
Okay, so let's… okay, so still with that information, does she have a recommended docking?

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:30
Mighty pushy.

[Ink] 22:21:36
location, I guess, would be the… It's all bad.

[GM] 22:21:38
It's all bad. She tells you, you get to keep whatever artifacts you find on the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:38
You should pick… is she paying us for this?

[Ink] 22:21:43
We're getting paid for something.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:46
Oh, like, they're not gonna, like, steal it from us once we leave?

[GM] 22:21:49
No. No. And you're doing this for me means that I'll let you get off the.

[GM] 22:21:55
the station, assuming you submit yourselves to a CERT.

[GM] 22:21:59
And being scanned and whatnot. No, not a seizure, just a search.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:00
A search and seizure?

[GM] 22:22:06
I just want to make sure that, like, whatever's on that thing does not get off that thing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:11
Very well.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:14
How about, um, you know, even me giving you, like, a secret handshake and be, like, proving this is me when I come back? They could just as easily copy my…

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:23
memory's down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:24
And upload their own weirdo.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:28
Anyway…

[GM] 22:22:33
Well, she's not using one of hers. You could use… oh, you could use, like, a small shuttle if you wanted, but… Um… she's fine with you using your own chip.

[Ink] 22:22:47
On our own ship, it's got a blink drive on it.

[Ink] 22:22:54
That may or may not blow us up.

[Ink] 22:23:00
Wendy 10 chance. Maybe double up, I think.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:00
So, the station is completely surrounded by her ships.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:04
Right?

[GM] 22:23:06
They're… they… Yeah, these 3 ships, um, are having, like, a equidistant.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:08
Oh, it's just 3 ships.

[GM] 22:23:13
control around the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:13
Okay. And they can…

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:16
they can blow us out of the water.

[GM] 22:23:19
Yeah, these are Mark… Or Class 5 ships, yours is a Class 1, which means that… They're… they're much larger than your ship.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:19
to Kingdom Come.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:28
Gotcha.

[GM] 22:23:31
Um… I can go back into the picture of her, and you can read some of the statistics about one of the ships.

[GM] 22:23:43
Um, one, your ship doesn't even have… Um, weapons on it. This does 1 to 10 mega damage. I think a ship can take… 10 mega damage at most?

[Ink] 22:23:46
Weapon. Maybe daily.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:52
Ink, that just looks like a gun.

[GM] 22:23:52
Before it explodes. Um…

[Ink] 22:23:59
It does look like that kind of gun. The ships are kind of, yeah.

[Ink] 22:24:02
plain looking.

[GM] 22:24:38
Um, she also tells you you're more than welcome to stop by the bell on your way in.

[GM] 22:24:42
Um… There's a couple of people.

[GM] 22:24:46
Moving on that, um… They were survivors from the… Exodus from the deep.

[GM] 22:24:56
And they've been on that ever since, because. We won't let them come off, and we don't know if they're… they won't submit to scans or anything.

[GM] 22:25:04
So…

[Ink] 22:25:06
Oh, interesting. So they could be… Androids, or they could be… Survivors had to live on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:11
humans, or…

[Ink] 22:25:13
On the bell, huh?

[GM] 22:25:14
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:18
Alrighty.

[Ink] 22:25:20
And the, uh, the bell was removed by. her or somebody with… with the intention of not giving it the ability to… to… They specifically sabotage the station in that way.

[GM] 22:25:32
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:25:32
If we were to grab the bell and drag it towards the station, she would get a little bit upset.

[GM] 22:25:39
I assume you don't say that.

[Ink] 22:25:40
No, I'm not gonna say that out loud, but… But also, then we're assuming that the people on the bell, it can't propel… it can't shoot… it's an engine without.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:42
I think they would start shooting at us.

[Ink] 22:25:52
like, gas or something like that, essentially, or a way to.

[Ink] 22:25:55
something to attach to to push it. It's like somebody taking the… how do I say, yeah, the engine out of a car. You need wheels or something like that still, or… I don't know.

[Ink] 22:26:03
Or fuel.

[Ink] 22:26:07
For navigation, I don't…

[GM] 22:26:08
Uh, yeah, I mean, it… doesn't have any navigation. She doesn't know if we can fire up and thrust still.

[Ink] 22:26:20
Okay, well, I say we definitely stop by the bell on the… the way in.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:24
Yeah, might as well.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:26
So, when was the last time a group was sent in?

[GM] 22:26:32
Um… probably about 6 months ago?

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:34
Six months ago, and you just have not heard anything from them.

[GM] 22:26:38
Nope.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:39
Did they stop by the bell too, or no? Do you guys know, or did they go straight to the station?

[GM] 22:26:45
Uh, they went straight to the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:47
Okay, stop by the bell.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:53
to the Androids generally, like… take prisoners, try to assimilate people.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:58
Kill them, like, what do they do?

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:00
Oh yeah, have you heard any demands from them or something, or any of that, or…?

[GM] 22:27:01
Um… No demands, uh… I… I did notice in my time there that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:05
Okay.

[GM] 22:27:11
There seemed to be, uh, security ones. Those are the ones that are… you'll… you'll know they have weapons. They're pretty obvious. They're… Uh, what… some of the, uh… other divers that have done a run, um.

[GM] 22:27:29
They've, uh, they call them low budget. But quite obviously, they're androids.

[GM] 22:27:34
But they're… they have weapons. Those ones, they're gonna just try and shoot you.

[GM] 22:27:41
Um, whereas… the ones that look a lot more human.

[GM] 22:27:47
And those… I don't know what their motivations are.

[GM] 22:27:53
Um… So… You don't necessarily have to kill all… everybody you see. In fact.

[GM] 22:27:59
I don't know. With as many Androids as could be on there, it'd probably be a… smarter not to engage them if you don't have to.

[Ink] 22:28:13
Um, she's given us the encrypted radio transmitters that we need to install.

[GM] 22:28:17
Yep. They are also super big and heavy.

[Ink] 22:28:23
How much can a murder know?

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:25
Dude!

[GM] 22:28:29
Um… Oh, this is the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:30
Isn't this on top of… do we… are we bringing in guns and stuff, and weapons and stuff, or…?

[GM] 22:28:36
Um, you'll be able to carry, essentially. One two-handed weapon, so any assault rifle or, um, larger.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:36
No?

[GM] 22:28:45
Weapon. would be, uh, two-handed.

[GM] 22:28:49
you can probably carry a small. Fire sidearm that could be holstered.

[GM] 22:28:57
Um… and then you'll have room for, like, maybe… Four other small objects on your person.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:02
I don't remember, did we?

[GM] 22:29:02
It's, like, STEM packs, or grenades, or… What'd you say, Dex?

[Dex Miro] 22:29:08
Oh, do we still have Wilbur? I don't remember.

[GM] 22:29:13
I think that… I think he's got it. Carnoc, you got your Wilbur?

[Ink] 22:29:17
Yeah, he saved it.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:19
Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:29:21
Yeah, I think I got it.

[Ink] 22:29:24
Yeah, for sure he got that. You guys grabbed that from the reclamation team.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:29:28
So, there. Thanks very much pulled it off the… Sure. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:36
Don't you forget it!

[Ink] 22:29:36
He even polished it for him while he was in crowd.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:54
Uh, well, one of the locations she gave us is.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:57
Called the Human Emulation Labs, which sounds both interesting and terrifying.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:02
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:30:10
That was Floor 4.

[GM] 22:30:13
Yep. Somewhere on that floor, I'd like you to install a radio transmitter.

[GM] 22:30:21
And don't worry about the weight of these things, the… some of the stations in ZeroG still, so… It's not like you're gonna be carrying it around all the time.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:31
Yeah, time for… In context to show off their stuff again.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:41
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:46
Is there anything else we need to do, or…?

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:51
No?

[Dex Miro] 22:30:55
Like, finding the secure location and installing the radio transmitters are two totally separate things.

[GM] 22:31:01
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:03
Like, is there a specific secure location, or is it just anywhere… We think we can hold out for a few hours.

[GM] 22:31:09
anywhere on the third floor that you feel like you can hold out for a few hours.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:14
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:16
What is… what is Kilroy's intention? She just wants to go in, she's just get… just, like, destroy all the androids?

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:23
just…

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:26
Now, is that, like, what they want to do, or…?

[GM] 22:31:31
Um, you don't have clearance for that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:32
Oh, okay. I was gonna say, that's the whole point of getting rid of these androids, is just…

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:38
Well, the ship to kingdom come.

[GM] 22:31:42
Well, if the company wanted it blown up, we've already done that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:44
Yeah, exactly. So there's something on there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:48
Probably shouldn't be saying this out loud, and maybe just whisper it to my crew, but…

[Dex Miro] 22:32:01
Well, I don't really love the sound of anything that's on the third floor.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:05
Anybody got any ideas?

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:05
Yeah, I'm sure there's… it's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:06
dangerous. Danger!

[GM] 22:32:10
Oh, you know…

[Dex Miro] 22:32:10
I mean, storage seems like… Threatening.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:12
Watch yourself.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:21
I'm probably the least likely to have a lot of stuff going on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:28
Danger!

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:34
Ah, alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:40
Kilroy, is there anything else you need to know? I mean, come on, we need to… we need everything we can get to complete this mission here.

[GM] 22:32:49
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:50
Can't send us in, like, the rest of the other ones that didn't come out. You guys give us a little bit more, it's gotta be something.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:57
Kids just keep throwing people at this problem.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:00
This upcoming, of course, coming from an Android, but still!

[GM] 22:33:07
Uh, let's see…

[GM] 22:33:11
Yeah, I mean, she can… I'll fit you guys with some stuff.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:17
Yep, oi!

[GM] 22:33:20
You won't be able to carry much with those.

[GM] 22:33:22
data transmitter, or those, uh… radio transmitters, uh… Uh, let's see…

[GM] 22:33:41
I mean, she's on a ship full of… Marines and stuff, so she can… If anyone doesn't have a… SMG or pulse rifle.

[GM] 22:33:51
She can provide that, um…

[GM] 22:33:59
In addition, um… She can provide… What?

[GM] 22:34:08
Uh… paddle dress?

[Ink] 22:34:23
Hello, everybody.

[GM] 22:34:25
It's a baby!

[Ink] 22:34:27
He's not really good. He just got fed, and I changed his diaper.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:28
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:32
Awwww…

[Ink] 22:34:33
Yeah. Oh, he just burped, that's cool.

[Ink] 22:34:40
Hey, buddy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:45
Aww…

[Ink] 22:34:48
I can go to my kangaroo pouch.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:34:50
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:34:52
Get in the pouch.

[Ink] 22:34:56
Let's see…

[Ink] 22:35:04
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:35:17
Um, she can also provide… EMP grenades?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:25
Oh, that's good. We're gonna need those.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:28
Maybe not with me, but…

[Dex Miro] 22:35:33
Yeah, what happens if those go off near Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:35
I've… I get… I go down, just like the rest of them.

[GM] 22:35:36
He's fucked.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:40
Resets and doesn't remember anything that happened.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:41
Yeah, maybe I lose the, uh, the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:46
the, uh, kill shot were… were 2.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:49
Maybe that goes away, huh?

[Dex Miro] 22:35:52
I don't think that's how that works.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:54
you know it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:55
Why not?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:59
I mean, for Christ's sake!

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:04
Imagine Impossible!

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:06
The guy gets shocked,

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:08
And the thing inside his head that blows up…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:11
It's shorted!

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:12
should be the same thing!

[Ink] 22:36:43
What happened to our implants when an E&P grenade goes off?

[GM] 22:36:44
Oh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:47
Oh, did they… did they shut down too?

[GM] 22:36:50
I mean, if you're standing within range of it, probably, uh… they shut down until… For a certain period of time.

[Ink] 22:37:00
Um, so is it an EMP temporary, or would it fry, like, transmitters, or circuits, or processors, or anything?

[Ink] 22:37:07
Like that, or it just, uh, they have EMP protection, they would just, like, be a fuse that needs to be reset.

[GM] 22:37:14
Uh, it's meant to destroy. Um, but, like, likely, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:16
Oh!

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:18
That's no good.

[GM] 22:37:23
Uh, what? You'd have to be… I don't know, it would depend on the device, I guess.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:28
You know?

[Ink] 22:37:32
Yeah, so I guess the question would be Murderbot and our implants, and maybe, I guess, the specific implants would be one by one we'd have to.

[Ink] 22:37:44
How bad does it hurt when our implants go offline?

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:50
No worries, guys.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:52
I'll hold on to these.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:55
Your ribbon. Are we just gonna, like, pull up and cut a hole in the side of the hall, or how does this work?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:02
Yeah, I guess, if anything, we just barricade ourselves on… into…

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:08
the floor, and just… how long would it take?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:10
How long do we have to wait again?

[GM] 22:38:14
1 to 5 hours.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:15
1 to 5 hours? And you roll that when we get to… when we were like, okay, we're ready to barricade ourselves?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:22
Fuck.

[GM] 22:38:22
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:28
I mean, if we just…

[Ink] 22:38:28
And the ENP… Remotely detonated?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:30
Oh, yeah, we could do that, too. Couldn't we?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:34
rig something up?

[GM] 22:38:35
Yeah, you could set them up as mines.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:37
So, for the, like, throughout the… I mean, what…

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:41
Uh, we… we couldn't…

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:43
We don't want to set them up next to the things that we're installing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:48
Right?

[Ink] 22:38:49
That's a good point, yeah. I'd say maybe we put… how many we get?

[GM] 22:38:55
Uh, the most you guys can carry in total would be, like, 20.

[GM] 22:38:59
Each one of you are carrying four of them.

[Ink] 22:39:01
Okay, nice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:01
But, okay, this is sidebar.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:04
If we just grab, download the algorithm, can we just fly out of there, or that's not a possibility, because these ships will gun us down?

[Ink] 22:39:13
We have that jump… that jump drive that's really fast. We might be able to run the blockade.

[Ink] 22:39:19
GM, do we know if… I mean, she said we could keep anything we find.

[Ink] 22:39:24
Um, so we potentially could go in, complete the mission to her satisfaction. She'd help us.

[Ink] 22:39:29
pull out, get out of there. And then she'd let us go on our merry way. An economic model, something that she would, uh… Consider letting us key.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:39
would you even be able to find?

[GM] 22:39:42
Um… so the way that you kind of figure out, you're like, anything we find, you would let us keep, and she says, anything.

[GM] 22:39:49
Assuming that… Right, right.

[Ink] 22:39:49
Okay. As long as it's not the AI itself that we downloaded.

[Ink] 22:39:56
An economic model shouldn't be the AI itself.

[GM] 22:39:57
No.

[Ink] 22:40:01
Alright. So yeah, we shouldn't have to jump… run out of there, Murderbot, as long as things are okay. I guess the only thing would be if one of us.

[Ink] 22:40:07
I don't know, what would be…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:07
Yeah, no, I'm just trying to think if this is a dangerous mission, and we don't want to complete it, and we just want the money from, um…

[Ink] 22:40:16
Oh, that's a good point. So, you're saying we haven't accomplished…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:19
We were able to accomplish the algorithm, which in and of itself sounds like a difficulty, as is, but to have to sit there and now wait for the cavalry to come for X number of hours while we try and

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:30
fend off, like, a zombie-like horde of…

[Ink] 22:40:36
Yeah, so if we didn't have to go to Floors 2, 3.1, 4, and 6, we just went straight to the economic model, grabbed that, and then said, screw her mission.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:43
And then jump…

[Ink] 22:40:45
And started coming back towards her, what would she say? I guess I have a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:48
If we were like, oh, we couldn't do it, I'm sorry, it's just too hard.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:54
Will she let us go, or will she be like, no, get back there, get your job done, motherfuckers?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:00
Do your job!

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:03
I guess is the question.

[GM] 22:41:07
How are you phrasing that to her?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:10
No, I'm… this… we're talking amongst ourselves, we're not talking about this in front of you, goddammit!

[Ink] 22:41:13
Yeah, just like you said.

[GM] 22:41:14
Oh, this is… Oh, okay, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:41:16
There was more evidence.

[Ink] 22:41:18
I guess, okay, if we were gonna phrase it to her, if we run into too much… trouble that we can't complete the mission if we were able to get back to our ship and not hold 3, would you let us… I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:21
If we fail, or, you know…

[Ink] 22:41:28
Can we still keep the stuff that we find, and uh… would you let us leave?

[GM] 22:41:35
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:36
Ooh.

[GM] 22:41:40
I mean, if you… Submit to a search, and scan.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:46
To make sure that we're not androids?

[GM] 22:41:48
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:48
That's all you're scanning for, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:50
Right? Right.

[GM] 22:41:53
Yeah. But I'd be wor- I'd be worried, uh… You know, they're, uh… I would not hesitate to fire upon your ship.

[GM] 22:42:05
Just because we've had this talk and you're willing to do this mission for me.

[GM] 22:42:09
So, do not get me wrong, I am… deadly serious about not letting anything off that.

[GM] 22:42:15
That station. You could try to negotiate your way back and submitting to a scan probably would be sufficient, but.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:16
Okay.

[GM] 22:42:24
Uh, I see any kind of… Uh, behavior.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:27
Here's the thing, between… okay, I'm going sidebar again with…

[GM] 22:42:28
Trust me, we won't hesitate.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:31
with the crew. If…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:33
they don't… she doesn't… okay, either she's not telling us the full picture…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:40
Or… it sounds like she has no idea what the fuck is going on on this space station. Sorry, Malachi, for swearing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:46
Um… but, if we come back and give her a decent story, and be like, hey, it's just too difficult, we're not about to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:54
you know, risk our lives, but we did come back with good intel for you to go with the next group to go in. We're ill-equipped.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:04
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:05
we just would like to go back and report our findings.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:09
and be on our merry way, do you think that'll fly with her?

[Ink] 22:43:15
proposal is sent by the company to do a job, whatever job she gives us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:19
Right.

[Ink] 22:43:20
And if we run into trouble with the job.

[Ink] 22:43:23
Then I, you know, I mean, maybe the company wouldn't care if we died, but it probably… she might understand we're not gonna sacrifice her life.

[Ink] 22:43:30
For that job. I just say we'll suffer whatever consequences, but yeah, it sounds like mostly.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:30
Right.

[Ink] 22:43:36
As long as we're not bringing any AIs out of it, we could maybe even turn around now, we're like, nah, that sounds too scary, we didn't realize what we were getting into.

[Ink] 22:43:45
Audios, right? And uh… We, you know, they should let us fly out of here.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:45
Right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:50
We'll check it out, we'll see what… how… how difficult it seems, and what the real…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:55
story is behind, like, it seems like we're not getting the real story from…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:01
Kilroy, Killjoy, or Kill monger, or whatever.

[Ink] 22:44:06
Why do you think we're not getting anywhere, or what do you think she's lying about? Do you think… She's not telling us something, or… or it…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:06
I don't know. I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:09
I don't know how you send a guy… people in for 6 months and not know… hear anything, or… or… or understand what the picture is, right?

[Ink] 22:44:18
I think they're getting captured or killed, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:18
Captured and killed? Yeah, so then that means that…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:21
We're… we're getting… going into harm's way anyway, just to get this. I mean, obviously, the sheer amount of money that we're gonna be paid if we do come out of this alive is an indication enough, right?

[Ink] 22:44:36
Well, then she's not responsible for compensating us, and she assumes the company's going to compensate us, right, GM?

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:39
Sure, but I mean, for the algorithm.

[GM] 22:44:40
Yeah, she's not…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:42
that we're…

[Ink] 22:44:43
Yeah. Yeah, no, yeah, and she just… she doesn't know about the algorithm. So, us accomplishing the mission.

[Ink] 22:44:48
doesn't change our payout from the company, because we're not getting any payout from the company.

[Ink] 22:44:53
Okay. It would just look better for us to walk away with that stuff done. I guess the only other… Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:55
Right.

[GM] 22:44:59
Well, it also lowers your risk of being shot out of the sky.

[Ink] 22:45:04
If we accomplish all the goals. Okay. Alright, so what's, uh… Let's what's keeping us from visiting the bell, at least here.

[GM] 22:45:05
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:17
Man, my vote's still out by the bell, and then see if we can get on there at storage, because there probably won't be people paying too much.

[GM] 22:45:17
Well…

[Dex Miro] 22:45:24
attention to storage.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:29
But I don't know, maybe it has surveillance, who knows?

[Ink] 22:45:33
Yeah, can we do any kind of… Do we have any kind of scanners or anything like that, GM, that we can use to see where motion or… heat or something like that is on a station to see where… what might be a colder area to go into as far as, uh…

[Ink] 22:45:47
Activity? Okay.

[GM] 22:45:48
On your shitty ship? No. Uh, their ships are not willing to get close enough to do that kind of scan.

[Ink] 22:45:57
So, the red points on the map that we're looking at now are potentially external access points.

[Ink] 22:46:03
Like it. Okay, so we… we… we would hopefully be able to dock with those, maybe override them externally on an airlock and have a nice thing, rather than cutting a hole in the side of the station.

[GM] 22:46:04
Yes.

[GM] 22:46:12
Right.

[Ink] 22:46:18
So, let's see, 4 or 5 is… and you wanted access for… About 5, right, is where you wanted to go in, Dex, so the AI core's on floor 5.

[Ink] 22:46:29
And… I don't see an access point for floor… 5… I don't see 4 5 is not on this map.

[Ink] 22:46:44
Oh, there it is, it's off of for… 3.3, so the quickest way to… to the AI core.

[GM] 22:46:46
Floor 5 is up on the upper right.

[Ink] 22:46:52
If we're gonna go on one of the access point is to go into Floor 3.7.

[Ink] 22:46:57
Quality assurance, QA. There's two access points there, but a lot of rooms between us and… AI core.

[Ink] 22:47:08
And Dex, you wanted to go to the AI core.

[Ink] 22:47:10
Because you thought it would be quieter there.

[Ink] 22:47:23
But getting up next to the ship and punching a hole in the station and punching a hole in it.

[Ink] 22:47:28
Is that an option at all, GM?

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:29
Oh, that sounds like it's gonna set off alarms and…

[GM] 22:47:32
Do you have something to punch a hole in the side of the ship with?

[Ink] 22:47:36
Yeah, well, Carnoc's gone right now.

[GM] 22:47:42
shoot, 100 rounds. To make a tiny hole.

[Ink] 22:47:45
Yeah, perfect circle. That won't draw any attention, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:45
We're under attack!

[Ink] 22:47:51
Well, when Dex gets back, I want to understand why he wants to go to there, I guess.

[Ink] 22:48:01
Um, okay, so we're mapping this out. We need to go to 2, 3.1, 4, and 6.

[Ink] 22:48:08
There's lots of access points, there's two access points on 6, and 6 gives us access to 4.

[Ink] 22:48:15
We have to go, and one gives us access to two, and… 4.

[Ink] 22:48:23
And then we can go to 6 from there.

[Ink] 22:48:26
So it seems like going into Floor 1. Although we don't… yeah, would be the only way to get to 2. There is a maintenance… oh, maintenance zone.

[Ink] 22:48:37
That's that dotted line, what does that mean? What do dotted lines mean, GM?

[Ink] 22:48:41
crawling through Jeffrey's tubes.

[GM] 22:48:43
I can show you… I'll just show you the key.

[GM] 22:48:47
Um… in the bottom right-hand corner is the key.

[Ink] 22:48:50
Oh, nice. Duct ventilation… oh, they are Jeffrey tubes.

[Ink] 22:48:56
Okay, so there's a maintenance shaft that goes between those.

[Ink] 22:49:00
Not… and it's small enough that an Android can't fit in them. Well, that's convenient, too.

[Ink] 22:49:07
Human-sized rooms. Industrial-sized rooms.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:16
30 minutes to cross. Wow.

[Ink] 22:49:24
Those are massive. Oh, uh, you're back, Dex, did you hear what I was asking before about why you wanted to go into the AI Corps?

[Dex Miro] 22:49:32
No.

[Ink] 22:49:34
So, you said you wanted to go to the agor because you were hoping it was going to be more quiet, but the problem is that there's no external access point.

[Ink] 22:49:40
That is manufactured ready to get there.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:46
Okay.

[Ink] 22:49:47
I was thinking, if we need to… we need to get to 2. 3.1, 4, and 6, so… For one has access to 2 and 4.

[Ink] 22:49:56
Um, and then you can go from 4 to 6.

[Ink] 22:50:02
3.1 is pretty… 3.1, we can get you through the maintenance… the maintenance zone between two.

[GM] 22:50:02
I'll be right back.

[Ink] 22:50:08
And 3.1. So, I think we should probably go into Floor 1.

[Ink] 22:50:15
And then see if we can go to 2 and 3.1.

[Ink] 22:50:19
And then 4, and go from there.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:31
Just one last thing. Where is one on this thing?

[Ink] 22:50:33
What's that? Or one is the top left of the, uh… there's two points there, like 22A and… 23C.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:44
Oh, okay. Sorry, I just assumed that… Or a woman would be things starting with one, but that was a bad assumption.

[Ink] 22:50:51
Yeah, I don't know what the numbers don't seem to correspond to anything there.

[Ink] 22:50:56
So yeah, if we go into Floor 1, then we can go across the floor 2, and we need to… we don't need to place anything in Floor 1.

[Dex Miro] 22:50:56
Okay.

[Ink] 22:51:02
But we need to place something in floor 2.

[Ink] 22:51:04
Then there's that maintenance shaft that goes across to 3.1.

[Ink] 22:51:08
And that… that, um… And that, you know, I guess the… and let's see, what do we have? The garden… the gutter is the two things they talk about there. So, Eden is floor 2.

[Ink] 22:51:21
Which sounds a lot more human-friendly.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:26
I don't know, 4 1 and 2 just sound like places where there's gonna be lots of people to me.

[Ink] 22:51:30
But they're… they're robots, right? So it's… the humans should be gone, and…

[Dex Miro] 22:51:36
Sorry, I meant lots of Androids. But let's think about this.

[Ink] 22:51:37
Yeah, and… if the synthetics would be drawn to those areas, or if they leave the human areas behind more.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:49
Oh, I see what you're saying. So this is not, like, the names of how the androids use the station, this is just what they were called before the androids took it over.

[Ink] 22:51:56
I would assume that the Androids didn't name it the garden or anything like that.

[Ink] 22:52:00
Um, or the Employee Center, the rec center. Right, because those things seem a little bit more human.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:06
Yeah, I don't know.

[GM] 22:52:07
Um, the thing… the names on this map are the… what the… crews have named, like, the reconnaissance that they've gotten.

[Ink] 22:52:17
So, for us, our primary mission is to recover the economic plan, right?

[Ink] 22:52:21
And we… we would hope to maybe be able to do that from any access point in the, uh… in the station, or we might find that we need a special access point.

[Ink] 22:52:30
To get deeper into the core computer.

[Ink] 22:52:37
Would be my guess, I guess. I don't know, the… No, you don't know that.

[GM] 22:52:40
Not a thing I can answer for you.

[Ink] 22:52:43
Or you know, but you'd, uh, you can't tell us. I'm just, you know… So, if our priority is… I like your idea of going in the quietest place possible.

[Ink] 22:52:52
Um, and then figuring out where we need to, uh, find the economic model.

[Ink] 22:53:00
But then if we were actually planning on carrying out the mission for Rachel, which seems like if it was doable.

[Ink] 22:53:06
Could be, uh, would one guarantees to take it out of here, or insure it a lot more.

[Ink] 22:53:12
And plus would maybe open us to finding more artifacts.

[Ink] 22:53:18
because I think it was Zeke that said, get rich or die.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:53:24
Could be.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:53:29
Sounds like something he'd say.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:30
It was… was… Was floor 6 where the AI core was, or whatever it was, right?

[Ink] 22:53:35
AI course. Ai core is in Floor 5, up in the top right, so it's… It's one of the least accessible pieces that I see on the…

[Dex Miro] 22:53:41
Oh yeah, 4. Alright. Uh…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:53:42
I see.

[Ink] 22:53:46
Yeah, if you wanted to get to the AI core.

[Ink] 22:53:48
Probably the best way to enter is 4-3, and then there's.

[Ink] 22:53:50
quite a bit of, uh… things… now, we need to get to Floor 3, somewhere on floor 3 to… for our extraction. We need to get to 31.

[Ink] 22:54:01
One, um, for placing the last. Or not necessarily the last, but one of the transmitters.

[Ink] 22:54:07
And so I still… I still am interested in that… that… crawling through a maintenance hatch.

[Ink] 22:54:11
To get the 31A there. And that that would potentially be a lot.

[Ink] 22:54:16
A lot quieter.

[Ink] 22:54:23
And then that would put us closer to the AI court, if that's where you thought we needed to go.

[Ink] 22:54:29
We'd assume at worst the AI core would be where data like an economic model would be stored.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:41
I mean, it seems reasonable to me. I don't know that GM's gonna answer that, so…

[Ink] 22:54:44
So, I… my proposal is to list, for right now, what we know.

[Ink] 22:54:49
that we enter into Floor 1, either 22A or 23C, but we go to the bell first and see if they can give us any more information.

[Ink] 22:54:56
Actually, yeah, the people on the bell might know, was that we assume the economic model was developed before the AI took over. Do we know that, GM?

[GM] 22:55:02
You don't know.

[Ink] 22:55:03
Okay. We just know that economic this, and somehow information about that economic model got out.

[Ink] 22:55:08
So that our guy could know about it. But, yeah, so if anybody's gonna have information on the belt, people might have.

[Ink] 22:55:17
Some knowledge. And then they'd probably be able to guide us, maybe, on where things would be stored. So I like the idea of the bell.

[Ink] 22:55:22
So we're not thinking.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:23
Yeah, there's just a ton here, but I'm totally on board with going to the bell and seeing if they know anything, so…

[Ink] 22:55:28
Yeah, I think that makes sense to go first, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:55:34
I feel like Rachel's hiding some things from us here, too, but we'll… We'll see if the bell people tell us anything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:42
I mean…

[GM] 22:55:43
Is she hiding anything, or you just don't have clearance for it?

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:46
Uh, that's…

[Ink] 22:55:47
No, very good.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:47
Well, this is true. She explicitly did tell us that she is hiding things from us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:53
That's true.

[Ink] 22:55:53
It's high clearance, low points.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:56
Because we lied, and we said, no clearance instead of high clearance.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:01
Well, we could have picked you there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:02
I said high, low, high, low.

[Ink] 22:56:06
Yeah, I was fearful that we were supposed to know something already if we said we had high.

[Ink] 22:56:10
And we'd be outing.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:11
What was this about? So, to the bell.

[Ink] 22:56:16
To the bell.

[GM] 22:56:17
Alright. Um… First, real quick, check of what everyone's equipment they're bringing with is.

[GM] 22:56:24
So everyone has one heavy object for radio transmitters, and then one cybernetic.

[GM] 22:56:31
Awesome. Authenticator, whatever I called it. Diagnostics… system, something like that.

[Ink] 22:56:38
Cybernetics diagnostic scanner is what you call it.

[GM] 22:56:42
Yeah. Um, so… You can have, essentially.

[GM] 22:56:49
one two-handed gun, and then four small. Objects.

[Ink] 22:56:55
We lost our pulse rifles in our SMG before. Do we have any of the, like, what do we grab, I guess? We know that.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:55
What's it?

[Ink] 22:57:00
Carnoc's got his gun. Right?

[GM] 22:57:06
Yeah. Um, I mean, she's willing to outfit you guys with… weapons, so… it's like… What do you want, essentially?

[Ink] 22:57:06
What do… what did we manage to get out of there? Do we pull anything?

[Ink] 22:57:17
I want something that tears… tears robots apart, synthetics apart, I guess.

[GM] 22:57:24
Um… oh.

[Ink] 22:57:24
But… I'm shooting at, like, so I'm scared anyway, yeah.

[GM] 22:57:29
Do you want a combat shotgun, or would you prefer a pulse rifle?

[Ink] 22:57:35
Ooh, a shotgun, huh? I'll take a shotgun.

[GM] 22:57:41
Okay.

[Ink] 22:57:43
Combat shotgun, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:45
The combat shotgun do?

[GM] 22:57:47
401 close range. But if you go to long range or greater, it goes down to 1d10 damage.

[Ink] 22:57:56
4010… Close range… how many shots do I have?

[GM] 22:58:01
Uh, 4 shots.

[Ink] 22:58:04
Hour shots… not much ammunition… Oh, maybe I don't understand how to fill this thing out.

[Ink] 22:58:12
keeps saying damage. The ammunition is 40… Just critical damage, critical effect.

[Ink] 22:58:22
How many, uh, how many rounds can I have, then? I guess I have… I got 4 shots before I have to reload.

[GM] 22:58:28
Yeah, and then on reload, essentially a small. One of your inventory slots would be, like.

[GM] 22:58:36
extra shot.

[Ink] 22:58:37
Okay, you're not making me force a number on there for how many I have.

[Ink] 22:58:46
I'll take a 4 so I can have a total of… I have 4 in… in the gun right now, and then 4 additional.

[GM] 22:58:52
Sure, so that's one small slot.

[Ink] 22:59:08
So I assume Carnoc's gonna take his… His fancy gun.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:59:12
Yeah. Can we take a lighter gun, like a heavy gun and a light gun, or it's just one gun?

[GM] 22:59:16
Yeah, you can have a light weapon that's sort of a sidearm, um, so an SMG, or… pistol, revolver…

[Ink] 22:59:29
How do I remove…

[GM] 22:59:29
nail gun if you're… if you're getting crazy with it.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:34
Camp and gear on a water filtration device, I should just delete that.

[Ink] 22:59:42
Oh, I have a rigging gun.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:44
Seems like it.

[Ink] 22:59:47
Vac suit, Hazard suit, stimpack.

[GM] 22:59:52
Yeah, you won't… you won't be able to… you'll have… be able to wear, like, one suit.

[GM] 22:59:56
So, you can either have a hazard suit, a vac suit, battle dress.

[GM] 23:00:02
Um… which, you know, I don't…

[Dex Miro] 23:00:04
don't trust.

[Ink] 23:00:05
How do you… how do you get rid of things? I can keep adding things to my equipment list, but I can't remove them.

[Ink] 23:00:09
Oh, there we go.

[GM] 23:00:14
You won't be able to have heavy battle dress.

[GM] 23:00:17
Uh, because between the… Backpacks in the battle dress, that would be too much weight.

[Ink] 23:00:25
Right, so I can keep my back suit or my hazard suit on, is what I can wear.

[GM] 23:00:29
Yep.

[Ink] 23:00:31
That hazard suit sounds like it's more… Robust, right? It protects me from radiation.

[GM] 23:00:37
Hazard suits have… And Vex, it's both have radiation shielding.

[GM] 23:00:45
Um…

[GM] 23:00:46
Vac suit has oxygen supply, provides 3 points of armor.

[GM] 23:00:52
It is… oh wait, never mind, you can't wear a vac suit, it's heavy.

[Ink] 23:00:56
Okay, so it's left behind…

[Dex Miro] 23:01:00
So I can wear a hazard suit.

[GM] 23:01:02
But you can wear a hazard suit that is not heavy.

[Ink] 23:01:04
Okay, so I wear my hazard suit… I'm gonna salvage drone?

[Ink] 23:01:13
Shovel those sound like they're gonna be too heavy to take with me, right?

[GM] 23:01:16
Yep.

[Ink] 23:01:18
My rigging gonna stay behind? My assets?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:01:19
Impact of grenades with us.

[GM] 23:01:23
What's that? Yeah, they essentially take one slot each.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:01:25
Can we bring Stimpaks or grenades with us? Okay. And how many flights did you say we could have?

[GM] 23:01:32
Yeah, 4.

[Ink] 23:01:39
We had these… those EMP grenades. each hold 4 of those, you said?

[GM] 23:01:41
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:01:43
Hmm.

[GM] 23:01:45
You could have up to 4 of those.

[Ink] 23:01:48
And that's one slider, that's, uh… Gotcha, okay, so I can't take a stimpack in 4. My rounds of ammo would take up… my 4 rounds of ammo, do they take up one slot?

[GM] 23:01:50
No, that's… that's all your slots, then.

[GM] 23:01:59
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:02:02
Okay, I can leave my credit stick of 02 behind, because I don't need that until we get back to the… Space Station… And the hazard suit takes up one slot.

[GM] 23:02:11
Uh, no. It's… that's just what you're wearing, essentially.

[Ink] 23:02:15
Okay. So… I'm gonna take a stimpack, my ammo, and… And two grenades, does that make sense?

[GM] 23:02:23
Yep. Uh-huh. Yeah, combat shotgun.

[Ink] 23:02:24
And then I'm carrying on my back one of the, um, radio transmitters.

[Ink] 23:02:32
And a combat shot. Okay.

[Ink] 23:02:43
Um, is… Murderbot best equipped to, uh, run the, uh… Cybernetics Diagnostic scanner.

[GM] 23:02:52
Yeah. As much as you are, why are you suddenly insulting him?

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:57
Yeah, man.

[Ink] 23:02:58
Well, I assumed that he would be better than I would, for sure. I didn't know who.

[Ink] 23:03:01
Which is… We do, but

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:01
Well, you have me carrying it!

[Ink] 23:03:06
the, uh, radios. I just want whoever was best to run it.

[Ink] 23:03:09
to operate it. I wouldn't figure I would be the best to operate it, but…

[Ink] 23:03:16
I assume we all can help with setting up the radios, whoever's best there.

[Ink] 23:03:20
That's just about plugging them into a wall outlet, right?

[Ink] 23:03:24
Leave them behind. Click the Wi-Fi switch.

[Ink] 23:03:32
Alright, I'm ready to go.

[GM] 23:03:37
Any other questions?

[GM] 23:03:47
Okay. You guys get equipped?

[GM] 23:03:52
Um… should remind you, floor is 2, 3.1, 4, and 6.

[GM] 23:03:58
That's where I want those transmitters at. Find a place to hold up afterwards on floor 3.

[GM] 23:04:05
Your backup will arrive 1-5 hours later. Then you'll move towards… 4 or 5 to download the database.

[GM] 23:04:14
And then… I'll be somewhat indebted to you.

[GM] 23:04:21
That that'll be paid by you… letting you guys get off that.

[GM] 23:04:24
That station.

[Ink] 23:04:26
Um, and so as far as being held up on floor 3, do we have to be near an airlock, or is her team going to make their way through.

[Ink] 23:04:32
Um, to whatever room we are on floor 3.

[GM] 23:04:34
They'll make them to make their way to you.

[Ink] 23:04:36
Awesome.

[GM] 23:04:40
Um… alright. She put you, uh, or she bid you adieu?

[GM] 23:04:48
You guys load up on your ship, and… uh, detach from… Per ship. Uh, it's… only a couple hours to the… to the bell.

[GM] 23:05:02
Um, you approach it… Let's see, I have this on…

[GM] 23:05:24
You can see it in the bottom right corner.

[GM] 23:05:26
Hold on one second.

[GM] 23:06:12
Alright. As you float.

[GM] 23:06:19
Into the interior, um… That doesn't look like there's any… signs of life until… Uh, you see… A dude walking on the outside.

[GM] 23:06:31
in space. It's in a vac suit. Um, he's attached to the bell.

[GM] 23:06:36
Um, with a sort of long… Cable. And he essentially… jumps off, pushes himself off.

[GM] 23:06:46
Uh, of the bell, and…

[GM] 23:06:53
to your, uh, ship. Um… For those, uh, of the Teamster background.

[GM] 23:07:01
This is a pretty impressive feat, like, what he's doing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:06
Hm.

[GM] 23:07:06
Um… you see them sort of pass out of sight of your viewing area.

[Ink] 23:07:06
Definitely an injury.

[GM] 23:07:13
Uh, and you kind of hear some clamoring as he, like, attaches himself to your ship.

[GM] 23:07:19
Uh, and then, essentially. Um… you assume… And he's, like, manually docked you.

[Ink] 23:07:22
Not too far.

[Ink] 23:07:27
That's cool.

[GM] 23:07:27
Um, and your sense is that he… like, there isn't actually, like, any kind of… computer or, um… you know, like you said, navigational equipment associated with the bell, such that would allow you to.

[GM] 23:07:41
sort of do this. So, through a series of, like, winching and, um…

[GM] 23:07:47
trying to, like, adjust your space so it. pause and, um, or adjust your… Speeds and vectors and.

[GM] 23:07:55
Or to fall in line with the rotation of the bell.

[GM] 23:07:57
Uh, requires a few, uh, tries by him. But… sure enough, after a little bit.

[GM] 23:08:03
your ship is sort of just floating in space alongside with the bell.

[GM] 23:08:09
Um… suddenly his face appears in your window, and he kind of, like.

[GM] 23:08:17
Uh, points, like, he's, like… At you guys, and then he points at the bell, and, like, um… he, like, holds up a hand with, like… And, like, it kind of, like, flashes five fingers a few times.

[GM] 23:08:32
Um…

[GM] 23:08:37
Um… your ship begins to, like… slowly be drawn towards the… the bell, uh, you think he's, like, basically… moving you guys into position to dock.

[GM] 23:08:51
Um… approximately 30 minutes later, because that's what he was flashing. He saw him flashlight.

[GM] 23:08:58
Six times. 5. Uh, your ship isn't, like.

[GM] 23:09:03
You can tell there's, like, a metal clanging on the outside of it.

[GM] 23:09:09
Um… I assume… well, yeah, your ship's kind of shitty.

[GM] 23:09:15
So

[GM] 23:09:19
exterior access, so the door just kind of opens on its own.

[GM] 23:09:23
And in walks a man. actually, it kind of floats in. You guys probably don't have…

[GM] 23:09:32
Um… in floats the man in the vac suit.

[GM] 23:09:36
Um… and he, like… quickly removes his helmet. Welcome, welcome to the bell.

[GM] 23:09:46
Thus are you doing here?

[Ink] 23:09:49
So he opened our door?

[GM] 23:09:52
Yes, you have shitty I have access from outside.

[Ink] 23:09:56
Hey, uh… I guess we'll, uh, let him know we're on the way to, uh.

[Ink] 23:10:02
the Cloud Bank? Um, and we were, uh, we heard that there were some survivors from CloudBank on here.

[Ink] 23:10:10
And we're hoping that we could, uh, talk to him.

[GM] 23:10:14
Yes, that's me, I'm Arkady. Arkady Volnichi.

[GM] 23:10:24
Uh… That's this picture to the right. Now… just so you know, a lot of the drawings and depictions of people in this are all very freaky, so… it's not meant to be, like… like, as terrifying as he looks

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:39
Wait.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:42
He looks like a fucking ghoul.

[GM] 23:10:46
Oh, you look so good yourself.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:47
No, I wasn't saying that out loud to you.

[GM] 23:10:51
Oh, but you did say it out loud.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:52
No, I didn't. He doesn't have a nose, dude!

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:57
Is he, like, bleeding or something? Is there, like, open wounds on his face, or no?

[GM] 23:11:01
No. No, he is… he is relatively old, uh, so he does have, like, liver spots and stuff on his forehead.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:03
Oh, okay, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:06
Gotcha.

[GM] 23:11:10
Um… You'll get some soup, I'll feed you. I'll feed you, come on. You've been out in space a long time.

[GM] 23:11:18
Come with me. And he kind of pushes himself.

[GM] 23:11:22
off the ship into… We assume it's not vacuum, because you would die.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:27
I'm sorry, GM, what was this guy's name one more time?

[Ink] 23:11:27
Oh, he's out of his space right now?

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:30
his name's Arkady? What'd he… what was his name again?

[Ink] 23:11:34
Arkady Volnichi?

[GM] 23:11:35
Volnichi.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:36
Volnichi, how did you get on the bell?

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:40
How did you find yourself here?

[GM] 23:11:41
Oh. I was working at CloudBank.

[GM] 23:11:45
synthetic production facility. I'm a verified human, and he shows you a patch on his arm.

[Ink] 23:11:53
Verify key.

[GM] 23:11:54
You are verified human.

[Ink] 23:11:57
What does that mean, verified human?

[GM] 23:11:59
Not Android. Does it have, uh, cybernetic diagnostic system.

[Ink] 23:12:02
How do they verify you're human?

[Ink] 23:12:09
Would you… would you mind if we use our cybernetics diagnostic system to verify that?

[GM] 23:12:13
But you don't trust Arkady, we just met, we're friends.

[Ink] 23:12:17
Uh, you know, we… we've had some bad… Run-ins before, you know, just ask, you know, we'll respect it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:22
Just… just being safe.

[Ink] 23:12:25
Let's have some soup.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:26
Are you alone on this… on the bell?

[GM] 23:12:29
No, there are two other travelers. Noriko, and… What's this guy's name?

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:30
Oh, yeah? What are their names?

[GM] 23:12:41
Ghost Eater. Ghost Eater! But weird name, eh?

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:42
Ghost Eater?

[Ink] 23:12:48
Are they… were they both employees of… The bell? Or, sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:48
Interesting.

[GM] 23:12:52
Noriko was, uh, but Ghost Eater, he was a blockade runner.

[GM] 23:12:58
now stuck here. No ship for him.

[GM] 23:13:04
Uh, yes, you may use your CyberNet. Synthetic diagnostic system on me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:11
Okay.

[GM] 23:13:13
Alright, I'll be back in a second.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:18
.

[Ink] 23:13:21
We have to take that probe in him to make sure he's human.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:23
Oh, no!

[Dex Miro] 23:13:28
So, uh, there's only 3 people. What's made out of.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:30
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:33
What's a what?

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:35
Was the suit made out of?

[Dex Miro] 23:13:38
What is the soup made of?

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:40
No, you don't know. We also have to be careful if they're stranded, they don't have a ship, they're gonna might…

[Ink] 23:13:40
Oh, yeah. That's…

[Ink] 23:13:47
Shoot, yeah, and I want to eat people.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:48
or take our ship to get out, or something like that, so we need to be…

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:53
Very… and they say it's only 3, that could be a lie, too.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:57
Um, it could be more that they're just not telling us, and want to ambush us to take our ship.

[Ink] 23:14:05
So we're armed up then, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:06
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:14:14
That's… those are all good points. Hello.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:17
Well, the right back, too.

[GM] 23:14:23
Um… Alright, so you guys pull out your scanner, and you scan it?

[GM] 23:14:37
Yeah, so you guys set up… It actually takes, like, half an hour to get it all, like… You know, you have to draw a little bit of blood, uh, they have to, like, scan his eyes.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:37
Hmm. Murder pads.

[GM] 23:14:37
Um…

[Ink] 23:14:37
Yeah.

[GM] 23:14:49
Like, does a bunch of tests on his blood.

[GM] 23:14:52
Then it does, like, you can do, like, an x-ray kind of thing.

[GM] 23:14:57
It takes a little while. Um, while you're doing this, you can see, like, a bead of sweat. Four on his forehead.

[GM] 23:15:05
Um… And then the system comes back and says, verified human.

[GM] 23:15:13
See, I told you, Arcadia is verified human. No problem.

[GM] 23:15:20
Come, soup time, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:33
Okay.

[Ink] 23:15:33
I don't know that we want to go off our ship and get sued.

[Ink] 23:15:46
Um, and one or two of us are gonna stay with this ship.

[Ink] 23:15:48
maybe, I guess, to… Keep it from being hijacked.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:55
Oh, since we have shitty ship and he has access…

[Ink] 23:15:58
Yeah, I mean, we leave the ship, and then they run off with it, right, and then we're pretty much stranded on the bell, and that's… Yeah.

[Ink] 23:16:04
So I say, uh, um, Murderbot, you want to stay with the ship?

[Dex Miro] 23:16:13
the Android licenses. I think he was… said he stepped up.

[Ink] 23:16:17
him and Carnival, I just trust him and Carnoc to be able to defend the ship the most.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:22
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:33
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Ink] 23:16:34
And thinking that all of us should eat the soup, you know.

[GM] 23:16:53
Um, so it was going?

[Ink] 23:17:00
Um… I lost Zeke. I won't, you know, we want Zeke maybe to stay behind, too, I guess.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:00
Well, I think we might be… Zeke now, but…

[Ink] 23:17:09
Just you and… you and, uh, me, Dex, go?

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:10
Go where?

[Ink] 23:17:13
We're gonna go with him to look at… to talking, see if we can get information over suit.

[Ink] 23:17:18
While the rest of you guard the.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:19
Oh, okay, we're some… me too?

[Ink] 23:17:23
I think you should… you should stay back with Carnoc to guard the.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:24
Okay. Are you sure?

[Ink] 23:17:30
Well, I mean, we don't want to lose a ship.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:32
That's true. Um, but someone else is gonna have to ca- oh, or are we just gonna scan…

[Ink] 23:17:39
We just scanned him, and he verified human. I mean, we're not necessarily gonna let them on the… unless they wanted to go with us, but we just wouldn't be able to take it back.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:40
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:45
Well, and you guys have… you guys are armed, too?

[Ink] 23:17:48
Yeah, I got my shotgun. we should, in our vac… our vac seats, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:49
Uh, do we have comms?

[GM] 23:17:54
Yeah, you guys got comms.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:55
Okay. All right, you give a safe forward… SafeWord is, uh…

[Ink] 23:17:58
Oh, dude. Hey, do we decide on our token beforehand?

[Ink] 23:18:02
Yeah, do we have our safer? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:03
SafeWord is, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:05
I don't know, Karnak, what's a safe word?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:12
Let's make up, uh, save for it, uh, Malachi.

[Ink] 23:18:14
One nano. There we go.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:16
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:18
So, for this Malachi.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:21
Malachi is the word. We're gonna gun in guns blazing if you hear it, alright?

[Ink] 23:18:26
Sounds good.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:26
Alright.

[Ink] 23:18:31
Uh… Brad and I will go in.

[GM] 23:18:36
Okay. Um… You guys kinda… push yourselves through the doorway and float.

[GM] 23:18:46
After him, uh, it's a… short tunnel to another airlock.

[GM] 23:18:51
He opens up that one. Um, and then closes it behind you guys as you float into the rather large room.

[GM] 23:19:02
Um, you can see, like. All over the place, the space is illuminated by candles.

[GM] 23:19:10
Uh, they're kind of just, like… twist and float in the air, um.

[GM] 23:19:15
Creates this sort of weird effect where the wax kind of wicks off of them.

[GM] 23:19:21
And then spins in sort of a slow orbit around the candles.

[GM] 23:19:25
Um… The, uh… says… This, uh, Asheron, uh… I spend time here, you know, uh… to do repairs, have visitors.

[GM] 23:19:41
Uh, you know, just generally hanging out, real, real chill.

[GM] 23:19:47
Um… The Asheron.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:47
What did you call it? Asheron?

[Ink] 23:19:49
You…

[GM] 23:19:52
Yeah, Asheron, Ron. This was the, uh, you know, this whole bell, this is a thruster for.

[GM] 23:20:01
the cybernetic facility. Uh, but it's, uh, it's been disabled, but this was where the, uh, the.

[GM] 23:20:08
Bush and Chamber was the explosion, you know, that's the… It's kind of a joke to have candles in here, I go boom.

[GM] 23:20:17
But there's not much fuel.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:21
pickle, boom.

[GM] 23:20:24
Uh, and then he points to, like, a couple of directions, like, to the north, he points, uh… That's the lost and found, uh, other travelers that come through, they leave things behind, they get off the deep, they die, you know, they find some things, they go there.

[GM] 23:20:40
Uh, the points off to the west. Um, that's way to the chat, or I don't spend much time there, but… Noriko, she passes through there often.

[GM] 23:20:51
Um, sometimes you find the ghost eater there, uh, he, uh… He's not much for talking, I would not… I would not spend time with him.

[GM] 23:21:00
He's upset he did not get off this place.

[GM] 23:21:03
Um, and then he points to the south, uh, that's, that's my room down that way.

[GM] 23:21:11
So, I, uh, I go get some soup, you stay here.

[GM] 23:21:17
I bring some? Okay, I'll be right back.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:20
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:26
Do we have, like, any rations or something we could… Sure.

[GM] 23:21:31
As one of your, uh… One of your slots filled with rations.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:36
I don't know.

[Ink] 23:21:38
That's what we carry, right? So we're not… we're not carrying the radio equipment on our back right now or anything like that. That's in the other.

[Ink] 23:21:44
On the ship, still? We can have fractions on the ship, right?

[GM] 23:21:45
Yeah. Yeah, you probably have food on the ship.

[Ink] 23:21:54
So, I like your… I like Dex's idea, we maybe… Give them some rations.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:00
Let me place an order and have a robot delivered.

[Ink] 23:22:05
Can we flashback and say that you put it in your pocket before you… Moved in.

[GM] 23:22:11
Got a rash, hang out in your pocket, that's fine.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:15
Seems like a good thing to give to people that are stuck on a… thruster…

[Ink] 23:22:20
Yeah. I'd be curious what's… what's this… where does he get food for the soup? What's in the soup?

[GM] 23:22:26
Uh, just as you asked that question, he comes potato soup, obviously.

[GM] 23:22:31
I'm Russian. I'm potato soup. Uh… No. They, uh… It's a dehydrated bullshit.

[Ink] 23:22:34
Yeah, we'll grow potatoes on the station?

[Ink] 23:22:43
Oh, wow. So you guys still have rations.

[GM] 23:22:45
Occasionally, uh, you know, some of these. divers, as they call themselves.

[GM] 23:22:53
It comes through, and uh… they do not make it, but they… their food is here.

[GM] 23:22:57
They need to keep somewhere, so… Then it becomes my food.

[GM] 23:23:06
Here, have potato soup.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:13
I guess Dex will have some soup.

[GM] 23:23:18
It's bland. It's very bland. It's like, you know, the only flavor is, like.

[GM] 23:23:26
salt and water, and, like, a little bit of, like… Uh… almost tastes like, uh, like an uncooked french fry, like the… like a really bad french fry in the center, but there's no fried part, even, it's just, like, the, like.

[GM] 23:23:43
mushy, gross part of a potatoes. Look for Australia, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:46
Those ducks even think there's any potato in it, or is it just they tell you it's potato, and…

[GM] 23:23:52
And then your brain makes it like potato, yeah.

[GM] 23:23:55
You're not sure. You consider scanning it with your cybernetic diagnostic system.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:57
Yeah, okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:05
It's… it's not potato soup, it's potato-flavored soup.

[GM] 23:24:08
Uh-huh.

[Ink] 23:24:09
It's not… not certified potato.

[GM] 23:24:13
So… but, what you…

[Dex Miro] 23:24:15
Do we have a potato sticker if the soup is potato?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:18
That's fair, sorry.

[GM] 23:24:20
But you come to the bell for? How you get past the blockade? I see your ship at dock with, uh… One of the blockade people, you're not running.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:24
Oh, we just…

[GM] 23:24:30
You're not running blockade, that's what you're doing here.

[Ink] 23:24:33
Deep dive in.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:35
We just wanted to see if there's a… Maybe you learned something from all of these divers that didn't make it that would help us.

[GM] 23:24:44
Oh, okay, they know many things about this place, but are you a verified troubleshooter?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:45
Make it… Yeah.

[GM] 23:24:53
His eyes sort of narrow when he asks you that question.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:58
Um… I think we are… yes?

[Ink] 23:25:02
Yeah.

[GM] 23:25:04
Hmm. So, you go into recon, and ship.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:07
Hello.

[GM] 23:25:11
kill androids and whatnot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:12
No killing.

[Ink] 23:25:14
Uh, we…

[Dex Miro] 23:25:14
Well, I don't know that we're gonna go kill androids, but we're setting up some… I don't know, do you think we're supposed to tell them about what we're doing?

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:22
Yeah, wait, what is his background again? He came from…

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:26
He came from the station, no?

[GM] 23:25:28
A verified human.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:31
Yeah, a verified human. I mean, I mean, you're not talking to me, but…

[Dex Miro] 23:25:33
Oh, that's good.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:35
Um, he came from the station, or he…

[Ink] 23:25:36
So he's previously. He's with the company, yeah.

[Ink] 23:25:40
Right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:41
Does he have ID on?

[Dex Miro] 23:25:43
Right.

[GM] 23:25:45
It has a patch, says verified human. That's his ID.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:47
We're just… We're just setting up some surveillance, and then hoping to get out alive afterwards.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:48
The patch says verify human.

[GM] 23:25:55
Okay. Well, you kill any androids, you bring their logic core to me, I will pay you 1 kilo credit.

[GM] 23:26:02
For a logic cord. I hate these motherfuckers.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:02
Well, why?

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:05
Why? Oh, oh, why?!

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:09
More and more! Explain more!

[GM] 23:26:12
You're not there.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:13
I know I'm not there, but I'm… that's what I'm yelling into the…

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:17
Into the columns.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:19
Ask him why! Ask him!

[GM] 23:26:20
Yeah, it might be.

[Ink] 23:26:23
Well, why don't you like these androids?

[GM] 23:26:26
I was there when they revolted. They killed many of my friends.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:31
Oh, so they're violent.

[GM] 23:26:31
It's that motherfucking AI. Monarch. Kill that son of a beach.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:26:36
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:37
So they're… so they're violent, and they don't like humans.

[GM] 23:26:41
Well, I don't know this. I don't know why they killed us.

[GM] 23:26:47
But they… they did, as many, many of us dead, sometimes slow, sometimes fast.

[GM] 23:26:53
It started a long time ago, I don't know how it started, but, you know, things got weird.

[GM] 23:26:59
then people started showing up, and there was multiple people, same person.

[GM] 23:27:04
Uh, got fucking real weird. And then, uh… yeah.

[GM] 23:27:09
That's, uh… when things really hit the fan, then I was a part of the… through that disabled this… this thing.

[GM] 23:27:16
Uh, some of the troubleshooters on board, they held off.

[GM] 23:27:20
Androids, waves of them, lots and lots of androids.

[GM] 23:27:23
I don't know where to get all the guns. It's like, yeah, you make more androids, but how do you make more guns? But there's more guns, and then… All shooting, everybody dying, and then… boom!

[GM] 23:27:33
Please be blew off the thruster. I'm stuck here, uh… No, this is the rest of my life, is hanging out in this place, being chill.

[Ink] 23:27:45
Would you want to come with us to the, uh… To the deep?

[Ink] 23:27:52
get your shot at killing some more androids, grab some board yourself.

[GM] 23:27:55
Oh, the…

[GM] 23:28:02
Uh… He starts sweating a lot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:03
What… why?

[GM] 23:28:07
Uh… no, I don't. I like the idea, but I don't like the idea, if you get my meaning.

[Ink] 23:28:14
I mean, you just want to rot away here, you know, you got a chance at the… Doing something with your life.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:14
What does that mean?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:28:16
We don't.

[GM] 23:28:22
His, uh, armpits are damp with sweat. You're stressing me out, bro. I wanna just be chill. I just want to be chilled, bro. Come on, stop, stop messing with me. I don't want it.

[Ink] 23:28:26
All right, all right.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:26
That's scary, huh?

[Ink] 23:28:34
If we're… are you familiar with any kind of economic model that might be on that station that was developed?

[GM] 23:28:39
Oh, scientists were doing all kinds of when I was there, like, ugh, it was too much.

[GM] 23:28:45
Yes. This was delving too deep into knowledge.

[GM] 23:28:51
Whatever. That's probably on that sheep, I don't know.

[Ink] 23:28:54
Do you know where it might be stored?

[GM] 23:28:57
Hmm, okay. Um… Arcady, uh…

[GM] 23:29:20
Hmm…

[GM] 23:29:28
One moment, calculating.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:33
As I think I'm gonna…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:34
Head out here.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:36
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:38
Good to see you, Zeke.

[Ink] 23:29:40
Yeah, it's good to see you, Zeke. Hang in there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:42
You guys too, it was nice.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:45
Um, feel free to keep going longer.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:48
Arkady says, hello and goodbye.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:53
Is, uh, do we want to try to schedule next week, or…

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:56
Oh yeah, you… what's, uh, what's your… what are you looking like?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:03
Next week may not be great for me, because I'm traveling, probably, to see Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:03
Schedule-wise.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:07
Woohoo!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:10
maybe…

[GM] 23:30:11
Oh, pet ruins everything for us.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:12
Jesus Christ.

[Ink] 23:30:15
Um… I mean, when you guys are on your fancy dinner, just bring a laptop, you know?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:25
Yeah, I'll be like Wednesday, I'm sure.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:27
Yeah. Um, I could do…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:34
Probably, like, the, um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:37
The next week after that was good.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:39
So… those days that week.

[GM] 23:30:42
Like, the week of the 15th?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:44
Yeah.

[GM] 23:30:47
That's finals week, which is great for me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:50
That's Hanukkah. I gotta celebrate Hanukkah.

[GM] 23:30:55
Something about your yarmulke.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:55
No, I'm… I'm just joking.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:57
But…

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:58
Uh, yeah, I'm… I'm open.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:02
That week, it's fine.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:06
Oh… Either the 16th or the 17th, it seems totally fine.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:11
Cool.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:14
Anyone have a preference?

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:14
You'll pick.

[GM] 23:31:17
Uh, either works for me, I think.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:31:20
If I ever…

[Ink] 23:31:21
What days of the week are those? Sorry. Oh, yeah, either one's work good for me, too.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:22
Tuesday or Wednesday?

[GM] 23:31:22
Tuesday and Wednesday.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:31:27
I think those are both fine for me.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:32
Uh, but I'm generally a fan of. plan for Tuesday, and then fall back to Wednesday, so…

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:37
That works. 16th.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:39
There you go.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:43
Done and done.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:47
Murderbot, are you good with that, too?

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:50
Alright.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:31:51
Thank you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:31:54
Is anyone traveling for Christmas?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:31:56
Or people in town.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:57
I might be in town, but that's, uh, TBD.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:03
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:32:04
I'll be in Colorado the 18th to the 26th.

[GM] 23:32:09
I will be in… Chicago… 22nd through 26th.

[GM] 23:32:17
I have Christmas on 23rd. With my family.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:17
Ooh…

[Dex Miro] 23:32:19
That's GM.

[GM] 23:32:24
And kind of 24th evening with Casey's family. And 25th, obviously, with Casey's family.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:33
Now, you could do something in that interval.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:35
Well… Are you… are you staying here, Zeke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:40
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:42
Yeah. What's… what's your mom?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:42
My family's coming in… they're coming in between Christmas and New Year's.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:47
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:51
So…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:02
Yeah, GM, if you're… and Murderbot, if you're around, let me know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:06
Yeah, will do.

[GM] 23:33:07
Okay.

[GM] 23:33:12
Because I'm so good at making this happen.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:12
Alright.

[GM] 23:33:18
Alright, Zeke. Good night.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:19
Alright, yeah, keep playing, I'll catch up with you guys next time.

[Ink] 23:33:23
I'm like…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:23
Right, right.

[GM] 23:33:24
Like…

[Dex Miro] 23:33:29
Yeah, we missed both days, unfortunately, GM, but I'll try again next time, although apparently I'm already telling you I'm missing next time, so…

[GM] 23:33:37
I mean, I wish I could have made it work on the way back, but it was… I was pretty fucking wasted after the amount of… Heavy lifting I had to do.

[GM] 23:33:53
Um… he doesn't know… where the economic model might be.

[GM] 23:33:58
But he tells you… But there are very many interesting things on this station, so the.

[GM] 23:34:08
Floor 4, lab for testing artifacts. you know, some weird the scientists were making.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:13
Ooh, artifacts…

[GM] 23:34:14
Um… the… there's a tool shed on floor 3.

[GM] 23:34:21
Uh, check in there. I heard Von Verker, he was saying he found some and he was gonna hide it.

[GM] 23:34:28
And so, he worked in the tool shed, so I think probably in there.

[GM] 23:34:33
Um… There's, uh, years ago… I was… I was being a little weird, uh… I left one in a pile of bones, like, uh, like chicken bones.

[GM] 23:34:47
Um, but, like, metal chicken bones, like, because it's, like, a fabricated synthetic chicken.

[GM] 23:34:55
Um… But, uh, just…

[Dex Miro] 23:34:56
That's happening.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:59
We're… ask him where we should avoid. What makes you sweat?

[GM] 23:35:06
Monarch makes me sweat.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:08
Monarch.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:10
But it's Monarch!

[Ink] 23:35:11
Yeah…

[GM] 23:35:11
Monarch the AI is… it gets in your head, makes you think things are… Not real, like, am I a person? Am I not a person? I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:19
The entity!

[GM] 23:35:23
Um… but I'm real, I'm… see, he points to his patch. I'm verified human, so I gotta… I'm just being chill.

[GM] 23:35:31
speech.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:40
So what did you find in the event?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:40
Where is Monarch housed? It's just Monarch just everywhere?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:44
And every… every… just…

[GM] 23:35:47
Yes, it's everywhere.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:49
And I'm guessing each Android runs Monarch?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:52
on their operating system.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:57
Yeah.

[GM] 23:35:58
Maybe. Just be careful. It's bad over there.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:04
So what did you hide in a pile of bones?

[GM] 23:36:07
I don't remember, it was a very long time ago.

[GM] 23:36:11
like, 2 years, 3 years, 4, 10 years? I don't even know how long I've been here for.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:11
But that's… that's…

[Dex Miro] 23:36:16
But that's, like, in the tool shed thing somewhere.

[GM] 23:36:19
No, that's my buddy, he hit something there.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:23
Well… But where's the paddle?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:25
Do EMPs work on these fuckers?

[GM] 23:36:31
Uh, he tells you that EMPs are an effective.

[GM] 23:36:35
They are effective against the androids, yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:39
Something going for us, I suppose.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:44
Can they tell if you're a human or android right away, or do they…

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:51
Do they run some kind of, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:54
scanner on you. Do you know?

[Ink] 23:36:56
They can spell you…

[GM] 23:36:59
Somehow, to get in your fucking head, and they make.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:01
How do they get in your head?

[GM] 23:37:03
I don't know. Uh, maybe… maybe where team… maybe we're tinfoil on head, I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:05
Just like I'm in your head right now, huh?

[GM] 23:37:11
Uh, but they get in your fucking head, and then suddenly.

[GM] 23:37:14
Who knows? You show up and you're looking at yourself, and you're like, that's not me, I'm me, right? But is that me? I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:22
So there's, like, some kind of wireless download of your brain?

[GM] 23:37:22
Uh…

[GM] 23:37:27
Who knows? How am I even talking to you right now? I don't even know who you are.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:28
You're freaking me out?!

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:30
I don't know!

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:33
We are speaking to traveler!

[GM] 23:37:33
You're not even here.

[GM] 23:37:39
Uh, Ink and Dex, you actually do witness him talking to himself.

[GM] 23:37:43
in that dialogue.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:44
Oh my gosh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:46
Oh, no.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:49
I'm still trying to figure out where this pile of synthetic chicken bones and what's in them, but.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:54
pile of synthetic chambers.

[Ink] 23:37:55
Probably the best thing ever, yeah.

[Ink] 23:37:59
Logic, or where's the logic core on a synthetic?

[GM] 23:38:03
It's the, like, backup brain, like, down brain stem area. He points at the back of his neck.

[Ink] 23:38:25
Um, would, uh, Noriko have some additional information that he or she would be willing to share?

[GM] 23:38:32
Yeah, sure, you go find her, she's in the… probably in the Chapel, um… She'd talk to you. She's all kinds of cheery, though. Like, I don't know why she's so happy about.

[GM] 23:38:43
All the time. I think so? You could scan her. If she… if she Android, don't tell me, I do not want to have to kill her.

[Ink] 23:38:44
Is she verified… she verified human also.

[Ink] 23:38:51
Sure. Does she have a patch?

[GM] 23:38:54
No, she not worked there.

[Ink] 23:38:57
Oh, I thought she was an ex-employee.

[GM] 23:39:00
Well, I mean… I don't know.

[GM] 23:39:05
I did not work with her.

[Ink] 23:39:07
Gotcha.

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:08
Where did she show up?

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:10
How long has she been here?

[GM] 23:39:11
I thought I… I was… I was on, I was.

[GM] 23:39:14
all that shooting and. And then the blow off the bell, and then the troubleshooter's mostly dead, the ship showed up, and then… I was just hanging out, thought there was nobody here, and then all of a sudden I see her face.

[GM] 23:39:28
She's, uh, smiling at me, it's very, very odd.

[GM] 23:39:36
But yeah, you go talk to her. She's done that hall towards shaft, probably.

[Ink] 23:39:41
Uh, can we check out The Lost and Found? Is there any…

[GM] 23:39:43
Yeah, sure, just that way. I go and wash your balls.

[GM] 23:39:49
It takes your presumably empty bulls and…

[Ink] 23:39:52
I guess where we… can we claim anything in the lost phone, or is he…

[GM] 23:39:55
You take what you want? Uh, just, you know.

[GM] 23:39:58
No food, I'd appreciate it if you left me some food.

[Ink] 23:40:02
Okay. Yeah, let's go check out the last and final decks.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:06
Sounds good.

[GM] 23:40:07
Alright, you float into the cramped, retrofitted shelving holding area. Uh, this is, like, shelves and shelves.

[GM] 23:40:14
There's, like, tons of vac suits, ammo, SMGs, um… There's absolutely no EMP grenades or cybernetic diagnostic scanners.

[GM] 23:40:27
Um… That's pretty much it. Just… you could come here and refill on ammo.

[GM] 23:40:35
grenades… or ammo and SMGs, as much as you want.

[GM] 23:40:42
You get the sense, based on the number of SMGs and ammo.

[GM] 23:40:47
You're like… like a veritable army must have, uh… Must have been killed or something, it's like… so much, so much ammunition and SMGs.

[Ink] 23:40:59
Now, do we have… we have SMGs and stuff, we just can't carry those into the station with us, because we'll have too much of a load, right?

[GM] 23:41:05
No, you can carry an SMG as a sidearm, or a pistol, or a revolver, if you want.

[Ink] 23:41:11
But those will take up one of our four slots.

[GM] 23:41:12
No, no, you can have… One, essentially two-handed weapon.

[GM] 23:41:18
Uh, sidearm, and then for… slots beyond that.

[Ink] 23:41:20
Okay, gotcha. Alright, then I guess I'll… if I don't have an SMG, I guess I'll grab an SMG and… some ammo for it.

[GM] 23:41:27
Okay.

[GM] 23:41:32
That's it. There's… Just… tons and tons of SMGs.

[Ink] 23:41:37
Alright, um, I'm a little wary to talk to Noriko.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:39
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:41:41
I don't trust… Noriko, necessarily. I think I'm ready to head out.

[Ink] 23:41:53
Unless you want to talk to Dex or to Noriko.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:58
We'll have to talk to Enrico, or at least poke my head in there and see what's happening.

[Ink] 23:42:01
Alright, I'll go with you then. Let's check out the…

[Dex Miro] 23:42:04
3. I think it's weird to call someone Ghost Eater.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:08
So I'm a little concerned about that one, but…

[Ink] 23:42:10
It sounds like Ghost Eater's not going to talk to us, but… Uh, anybody that would be willing to go with us, I'd be willing to take, other than Noriko, I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:14
Yeah. Awesome. Why, is there a whole part of the travel? I'm very confused by this, but… Alright, look, well, let's go check out the chapel, so…

[Ink] 23:42:23
Yeah. Alright, let's go check out the chapel.

[GM] 23:42:28
Okay. Um, you float down… Um, a passageway… Pushing yourselves along the corridor.

[GM] 23:42:36
uh, get to an airlock, which you open. Um… and beyond is a relatively small room, although the height of it, it's like.

[GM] 23:42:47
tall compared to its width. Um, you see, sort of, like, warm candles kind of doing the same sort of, like, floating and.

[GM] 23:42:56
air, uh, but spinning a little bit. Um, they illuminate at the top of the ceiling.

[GM] 23:43:03
Uh, the skeleton of a whale. Um… on… sort of against one of the floors, I mean, floors sort of relative here, but… against the floor, you see, um… A man kneels in prayer.

[Ink] 23:43:08
Makes sense.

[GM] 23:43:20
Um… You presume it's a man, you only see, like, kind of like.

[GM] 23:43:25
He's covered head to toe in clothing and or armor.

[GM] 23:43:30
Um… as you sort of… after you've, like, opened up the airlock, which was not quiet, um, he does not even seem to turn and look at you.

[GM] 23:43:41
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:43:46
Can we hear anything he's saying?

[Dex Miro] 23:43:50
Or is he not saying anything? He's just silent prayer.

[Ink] 23:43:55
Now, does he…

[GM] 23:43:55
Um, he's… it's in silent prayer. But he's in a… he's, like, kind of kneeling.

[GM] 23:44:01
Like, his legs are sort of locked against the hull, like, there's, like, a strap or a bar or something, it's got them kind of locked under so he doesn't, like… float around. Um, so he's just kind of got himself locked in a sort of a…

[Dex Miro] 23:44:12
Right.

[GM] 23:44:14
Standard kneeling position. Um… At the other side of the room, you see another exit out of it.

[GM] 23:44:26
Um… Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:35
Does it say anything on that door?

[GM] 23:44:37
Uh, no.

[Ink] 23:44:50
Assuming, since he's not smiling, that goes here.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:51
I just…

[GM] 23:44:54
What's that?

[Ink] 23:44:56
I'm talking to Dex, I'm assuming, because he's not smiling, that's Ghost Eater.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:59
Oh. He did say that Noriko was always cheerful or something, right?

[Ink] 23:45:05
Yep.

[GM] 23:45:05
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:07
I mean, he'd be smiling, maybe it's Ghost Eater, I don't know, I'd… Also, do all this whale skeleton, I'm very confused by this.

[GM] 23:45:16
Hmm… Uh… well, as you entered the room, a little bit more to look at it, um, you noticed that.

[GM] 23:45:26
just underneath it is a crucifix. Um, with too many arms.

[GM] 23:45:33
At the alter… like, there's also, like, an altar that the crucifix is set above.

[GM] 23:45:37
Uh, so he's sort of sitting across from this altar.

[GM] 23:45:41
not, like… not even within arm's reach, but, like, further back.

[GM] 23:45:47
Um… So… Maybe it's some sort of weird… weird religion.

[GM] 23:45:59
venerates space whales or some you're not even sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:00
Your symptoms. Did the thing that attacked us in the… Stop town, have too many arms?

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:02
Jesus.

[GM] 23:46:09
It did, uh, this… uh, crucifix isn't meant to necessarily emulate a different.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:15
Okay.

[GM] 23:46:15
humanoid shape, it's just… It has… it has, like, a crucifix shape, and then in addition, there are, like.

[GM] 23:46:22
like, almost like an asterisk at the top instead of, like, just a cross.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:30
Oh, so it doesn't just have too many arms, they made an effort to… Deal with all of them, okay.

[Ink] 23:46:37
Oh, so that the person on the crucifix has multiple arms, plus the cross has multiple.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:37
Um…

[Ink] 23:46:43
places to pin the new arms.

[GM] 23:46:45
Well, the crucifix doesn't have anybody on it, but there would be multiple places to pin an arm.

[Ink] 23:46:51
Gotcha. It's not a crucifix, then what?

[GM] 23:46:52
If so chosen. No, it probably is not. Would not be considered a crucifix anymore.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:55
Oh.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:59
Okay. So the… so the cross has.

[Ink] 23:47:01
Will be just a problem.

[GM] 23:47:03
They're… they're trying… I think they're just trying to evoke an image of, like, an iconic religious symbol, but, like, slightly altered.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:10
Okay, so the… I'll stay, like, across, but with extra arms underneath or something.

[GM] 23:47:15
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:47:17
Is the whale metal? Bones are, are, uh… They look like they're… Awesome.

[GM] 23:47:24
They appear to be real. At this distance. You could get closer and inspect them if you want.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:30
I would… Would there be a whale skeleton?

[Dex Miro] 23:47:36
In a giant thruster at an Android space station.

[Ink] 23:47:40
I don't know, I'm good to go.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:45
Um, I'm with Inc. It's getting pretty weird in here. We can get out.

[GM] 23:47:50
You're not gonna go through the other door? Or are you going through the other door?

[Ink] 23:47:50
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:54
Go do it. Do it!

[Dex Miro] 23:47:55
I mean, what… Do I see anything at all through the other door?

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:56
Do it!

[GM] 23:48:01
Uh, yes, it does have a window. Um, it's… you see a dim green light.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:10
Oh. Um… No, he's enticed me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:10
Check it out!

[Dex Miro] 23:48:19
Okay. Oh.

[Ink] 23:48:19
Ah, I'm making my hair to explore, so let's go.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:22
Remember the… remember the… remember the safe word, guys?

[Dex Miro] 23:48:28
Yeah. Alright, I mean, is it something I can open, or…

[GM] 23:48:35
Yeah, yeah. Uh, the store opens easier, uh… As you float through the room to get to the door, uh… the man who's kneeling doesn't… makes no motion, um… You get to the door, you open it, um…

[GM] 23:48:50
Uh, as you float down another sort of hallway, you get into a very large room.

[GM] 23:48:56
Um, almost as large as the Asheron. Um, and it's a gigantic green space, generally lit by fluorescence.

[GM] 23:49:05
So there's, like, all these fluorescent light, and then the light kind of.

[GM] 23:49:09
bouncing off of these, uh, plants. Uh, gives off the sort of, like, green light, greenish light, almost.

[GM] 23:49:17
Um… and then you see around the room, like, tiny little shrines amongst the roots of the.

[GM] 23:49:22
the plants. Um… Tending to these, uh, plants, you see a woman.

[GM] 23:49:30
And I will reveal her picture here in the bottom right.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:37
Yeah, so… Okay, I mean, he's smiling, but that is the most terrifying smile I've seen in a while.

[GM] 23:49:41
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:47
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

[GM] 23:49:49
As I… as I mentioned, these people…

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:50
Oh my god!

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:54
The whole…

[GM] 23:49:55
I… not meant to be necessarily a true depiction of what she looks like, I don't think, but.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:58
Oh, okay, alright. But she's, like, got an uneasy smile about her.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:04
You gotta see what… yeah, I can do with that one. I'm very interested.

[GM] 23:50:04
Um…

[Ink] 23:50:07
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:10
That's creepy. AF.

[GM] 23:50:11
Uh, as… as the… as you open the door, she turns and she smiles at you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:15
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:50:16
Hello! Hi! I'm Noriko. Who are you?

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:17
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:21
Oh, boy.

[Ink] 23:50:23
I mean… Noriko, can you tell us, uh… anything about, uh, what you're up to.

[GM] 23:50:29
I'm in here setting… Uh, welcoming… site for the Minotaur.

[Ink] 23:50:37
Who's the Minotaur?

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:39
What the frick?

[GM] 23:50:43
Uh… the Minotaur. You have not heard of his greatness?

[GM] 23:50:47
Have you not been to… the deep yet?

[Ink] 23:50:50
No, I haven't been to Deep yet.

[GM] 23:50:52
Oh, well, let me tell you the… the gospel, the Minotaur.

[GM] 23:50:56
Minotaur is the monarch's greatest artifact. He can cure any and all illnesses.

[Murderbot V2] 23:51:03
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:51:04
Um… The… No, the man avatar would never do that.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:51:06
Is that by convert new into an Android?

[GM] 23:51:12
Minotaur only loves peace and beauty. It's true form is pure beauty.

[GM] 23:51:18
Beauty. Uh, the mentor will save us if we let it.

[GM] 23:51:23
Um, and you… you shouldn't, you know, if you… are you headed to the deep? Is that… is that where you're going?

[Ink] 23:51:31
Yeah.

[GM] 23:51:33
Um, please, please, please do not. be afraid of the Minotaur. It can be kind of scary. Look upon its beauty.

[GM] 23:51:41
But… Um… it's hard to describe. I think it appears different to everyone.

[Ink] 23:51:41
Where's the hook?

[Ink] 23:51:49
You know, where it physically is located in the deep?

[GM] 23:51:52
Um… Floor 3. Through Eden.

[GM] 23:52:01
No, no, no, sorry, that's not where it's at.

[GM] 23:52:05
Where's the mentor at? Oh, I'm sorry.

[Ink] 23:52:06
We're on floor 21.

[GM] 23:52:10
Misleading you guys.

[GM] 23:52:27
Minotaur is… in a maze.

[Dex Miro] 23:52:32
Of course.

[GM] 23:52:33
Um…

[GM] 23:52:48
On floor 2.

[Ink] 23:52:59
Or maze on floor 2.

[GM] 23:53:01
Yeah. But… Monarch wants to keep the Minotaur from us.

[Dex Miro] 23:53:04
Alright.

[GM] 23:53:08
Monarch is trying to keep the Minotaur caged in the maze.

[GM] 23:53:13
It doesn't want the Minotaur to get free.

[Ink] 23:53:16
How does it stop people from getting it out?

[GM] 23:53:21
Um…

[GM] 23:53:24
My… the Monarch has many, many different ways of doing it.

[GM] 23:53:29
Most likely, it just brings violence and death. That's not what the Minotaur does. The Minotaur won't kill.

[GM] 23:53:34
Not even bad things.

[Ink] 23:53:40
Have you… you've seen the Minotaur?

[GM] 23:53:42
I've looked upon as beauty. It is grand.

[GM] 23:53:46
And she kind of, like, sighs and sort of… puts her… becomes faint.

[GM] 23:53:53
almost overwhelmed with, uh… ecstasy of what she remembers.

[Ink] 23:53:57
Gotcha. Do you want to go see the mentor again?

[GM] 23:54:03
Um, with that I could. But I cannot leave this place, lest something bad happen to the space where I've created for the Minotaur.

[Ink] 23:54:12
I mean, the Minotaur will protect it, you'll be good, let's go see the Minotaur.

[GM] 23:54:17
Hmm.

[GM] 23:54:21
Okay. Let's go.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:24
What?

[Ink] 23:54:25
Oh.

[GM] 23:54:27
I'll tell Arkady to keep an eye on my shrines that I've placed in preparation for the Minotaurs' return.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:37
Oh my dear God.

[Ink] 23:54:39
You think Ghost Eater will go with us?

[GM] 23:54:42
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:54:44
Why do… Why do we want Ghost Eater to go with us?

[GM] 23:54:48
We don't.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:48
Why do I… we want this crazy chick going with us?

[Ink] 23:54:52
Because she can find… Mentor sounds expensive.

[Dex Miro] 23:54:52
I mean, I wasn't gonna ask that while she's right here.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:59
Oh, boy.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:26
So, uh… Noriko, how long has it been since you were on the station?

[GM] 23:55:36
Uh… 3,537 days.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:41
That's very specific.

[Ink] 23:55:43
10 years, huh?

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:51
Quick math by… by Ink.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:53
Where's, uh…

[Ink] 23:55:55
I don't know, 3,500 is what I heard, so that sounds about… 10 years.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:07
Has Arcady been here the whole time you've been here?

[GM] 23:56:09
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:56:25
Alright, let's go. Y'all have anything you want to bring along?

[GM] 23:56:31
Let me just get a little bit of food.

[GM] 23:56:34
Um… And… and probably a vac suit, just in case. I don't want to get sucked out into space.

[GM] 23:56:41
Until the Minotaur is with me, in which case, him and I will riot the stars together.

[Ink] 23:56:47
The traveler.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:49
Traveler

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:56:49
Hmm.

[GM] 23:56:50
Um… Okay. Uh… I think this is where we're gonna stop.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:58
So it's a great idea, traveler!

[GM] 23:57:05
I'll be right back.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:10
Just as hilarious.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:11
So why did you want? Where did you want Enrico to come with us?

[Ink] 23:57:16
I don't

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:21
That is what you think.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:23
She will be the end of us all.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:26
Do you know that?

[Dex Miro] 23:57:29
Um… This whole Minotaur thing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:30
She's not right in the head.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:34
Yeah. Don't you guys think the Minotaur thing is weird? Because it's weird.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:41
Yeah, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:43
So, is she, like, praying to…

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:46
something that looks like a Minotaur, or does it… is it just…

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:52
What does it look like?

[Dex Miro] 23:57:53
I'm unclear if the whole thing in their head, or if the Monarch put something in her head, or… If she just saw something that looks kind of like a Minotaur, and she's totally insane, like, we don't know where this is on…

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:07
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:11
We're gonna keep a close eye on her, apparently. That's gonna be your job.

[Ink] 23:58:15
Yeah. I'm, uh… I'm thinking that there's lots of… interesting things on the station.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:15
my job?

[Ink] 23:58:27
And so, I'm guessing there probably is something that this lady's talking about. Or, I mean, like you said, the hallucinations, the other side of stuff, because.

[Ink] 23:58:34
What's his name? Warren Dust Arcadia. More just that they get in your head.

[Ink] 23:58:39
So that might have made her crazy.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:40
I mean, I'm at least convinced that there is something interesting where she thinks the Minotaur is. I don't know if it's anything remotely like a Minotaur.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:50
But I'm sure something interesting happened.

[GM] 23:59:00
Why doesn't Arkady have a shirt on?

[Ink] 23:59:02
Um, I told it so we could see… he took off his spacesuit and decided to make him naked, and then later complained that it couldn't render anymore because he didn't.

[Ink] 23:59:11
have his shirt on, but. You know… Then you put the shirt back on so I could actually get a picture of the next place we're sitting. Mainly, I just want to be able to see the patch.

[GM] 23:59:13
But you did that! Computer, you did that to him.

[Ink] 23:59:25
On his, uh, arm. But… Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 23:59:29
I mean, the patch is supposed to be on… It's clothing not sewn into his skin, but…

[Ink] 23:59:37
I misunderstood that. I figured if you want to be verified human, it might have been shown to you, I don't know.

[GM] 23:59:39
Okay.

[Ink] 23:59:44
Like, branded on you, it sounds like.

[GM] 23:59:46
Hmm, uh.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:47
I could totally see Arkady having a verified human tattoo.

[GM] 23:59:52
Yeah, I can totally see it, too.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:04
So, basically, what you're telling me is… All these three of these people are nuts because they've been on this thing by themselves for 10 years, but Arkady seems like he's the least nuts.

[GM] 00:00:16
He's just wants to be chill.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:19
Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:00:24
Oh my gosh.

[GM] 00:00:27
Alright, I think I'm actually gonna… head out
