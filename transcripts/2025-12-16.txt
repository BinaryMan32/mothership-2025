[GM] 21:52:22
all the stuff they need to be able to do whatever they need to do.

[GM] 21:52:24
All right there.

[Ink] 21:52:29
And we still have no, um… Gravity?

[GM] 21:52:34
There's no gravity, as far as I can tell.

[Ink] 21:52:47
So, yeah, we don't really have any… place to hold this suit, or the welder, or anything like that, so we can't… and we already have make shoes?

[GM] 21:52:56
Here I have what? Yeah. Yeah, you're… if you're wearing a, uh… A vac suit, you have mag boots.

[Ink] 21:53:01
Okay, so no reason to try to scavenge this stuff. Um, does the area look… like, pretty much dust… I don't know, would you get dust in your… like, does it… look like anybody's been here for what?

[GM] 21:53:13
It is relatively clean in this room. whether it's because the ventilation's working real well, or if somebody comes and cleans it, it's not… really quite clear, um… It's still dark in here, so, like…

[GM] 21:53:27
Your lights are picking up, like. flecks of dust in the air, but it's not.

[GM] 21:53:32
You know… it's hard to say it's dusty on account of the gravity as well.

[GM] 21:53:40
But it's not, like, it's… you have… Very good visibility.

[Ink] 21:53:44
Okay. Yeah, and I guess I was more looking for, uh, are we gonna meet anybody here soon, or maybe this area's not very… Interesting, because the… the bell has been disconnected.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:57
Yeah, probably not very interesting.

[Ink] 21:53:59
GM, on our approach, did we see any. any spaceships attached to the outside of… the cloud bank, I mean, I guess we didn't ask that before, of if there's all these dives into the… in the deep.

[Ink] 21:54:11
did they generally, when the people try to come back, they just shot them out of the sky, so all the ships have left?

[GM] 21:54:19
You did not see any ships on the outside of the CloudBank facility.

[Ink] 21:54:33
461D right now, right, GM?

[GM] 21:54:36
Uh, yes.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:40
Do we know what the override is for, or do we think it's what you flip, what you… Something with a thruster.

[GM] 21:54:52
Um… I mean, it looks like a control console.

[GM] 21:54:55
Uh, but it's not powered up, so you're not sure what the override switch would even override at this point.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:56
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:01
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:14
And we probably shouldn't be powering things up if our goal is to have people not detect us, so probably best to move on.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:28
Are there, like, cameras everywhere? Do we already know that?

[GM] 21:55:33
Um… you look around for cameras, you're… Guessing not many were installed in this area on account of it being a mostly maintenance space.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:14
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:19
What's going on?

[GM] 21:56:19
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:22
I guess we move to the next room unless we see something that makes us think we should stop.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:26
What number?

[Ink] 21:56:28
61C is where we're headed, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:56:29
Oh. Yeah. Then we have to decide whether to go left or right, which is…

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:30
61C, okay?

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:34
There's nothing… nothing here?

[Ink] 21:56:36
So… Nothing we want to mess with, just a giant control that's turned off, and a red button that says… switch that says override that.

[Ink] 21:56:44
We don't know what it does. But Dex… Dex suggested that we don't want to just start messing with things right now.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:47
I go take… I go take a look at the button.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:51
I'll go take a look at the button.

[Ink] 21:56:53
Okay.

[GM] 21:56:53
It's… there's a common… large red override switch.

[GM] 21:57:00
It's like… Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:01
We're right next to the airline.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:04
I look at it with curious eyes.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:09
Just one push.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:11
Just one.

[GM] 21:57:12
It's a switch, it's not a button. It's a switch.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:14
Just one.

[GM] 21:57:14
You have to flip it, no pushing.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:15
Just one flick. Just one flick.

[Ink] 21:57:20
Does it have one of those little plastic containers over it, you know, like, to make sure you just can't accidentally hit it?

[GM] 21:57:23
Yeah, it's encased in glass.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:25
Yeah. The whole… The whole console was, or just the Switch?

[Ink] 21:57:26
Oh, very good.

[GM] 21:57:30
Uh… I think it's the whole council, like, you have to, like… Well, it's not emergency use. You could, you could flip it up. You don't have to crash it, like, you don't have to, like, break it, it's just…

[Dex Miro] 21:57:33
Okay, so this whole thing is, like, emergency use only.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:40
Yeah, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:42
Right. So…

[GM] 21:57:42
Yeah, but it does seem to be protecting, like, if something were to float through the air, it doesn't want, like, necessarily hit the override button, or switch.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:49
Yeah. Now they've got you doing it.

[GM] 21:57:50
Accidentally.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:54
61C…

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:57
We go either to 61D,

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:00
Right?

[Ink] 21:58:03
Well, first we gotta get across the giant, you know, take an hour, I think, to get across.

[Ink] 21:58:07
61… the 61 area, right? It looks like 6 industrial-sized rooms together.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:09
Oh, that's just one huge room?

[Ink] 21:58:16
in probably an hour to cross it.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:16
I see.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:20
Okay.

[Ink] 21:58:21
So let's look inside there. What's in there?

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:23
In 61C?

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:25
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:25
Yeah.

[GM] 21:58:26
Alright, go up to the airlock to open it. It is locked.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:30
Motherfucker!

[GM] 21:58:31
Um… That being said, um, the Teamsters know that.

[GM] 21:58:36
Uh, you could either grab the, um… hand-welder out of the… Uh, vac suit container, and just, like.

[GM] 21:58:44
Basically, hand-weld cut through the, uh, the locking mechanisms on this.

[GM] 21:58:53
Or if you have a hand welder on yourself, you don't have to get the one out of the vac suit container.

[Ink] 21:58:59
I think I have a handle there. Let's see… I have… heavy machinery operations… scavenging and jury rigging.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:00
I don't think I do.

[Ink] 21:59:11
So I'm… I'm willing to give my, uh… suggest that I might use the hand welder. Dex, you might be the other one, right?

[Ink] 21:59:23
Oh, mechanical. You have mechanical repair? Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:24
Uh, mechanical repair.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:26
Yeah.

[GM] 21:59:27
You don't need a skill for this, it's a… this is a standard Teamster thing to do, is to.

[GM] 21:59:32
Weld and or un-weld certain things.

[Ink] 21:59:32
Okay, well, I grabbed that… I grabbed that welder, I like welders, so I'm gonna cut through the door.

[GM] 21:59:36
Alright. You're the… the… It's, you know, not-so-subtle.

[GM] 21:59:44
The flame ignites, and then, uh… you begin, um, cutting through the things.

[GM] 21:59:50
You know, some sparks shoot off the… uh, metal becomes red hot and begins to.

[GM] 21:59:56
melt quite quickly. Um… you're careful enough, and this is, you know.

[GM] 22:00:04
demonstrating your skill as a teamster, to note that the.

[GM] 22:00:08
As the, uh, metal super-heats and floats away, not to catch yourself with liquid.

[GM] 22:00:14
Hot metal, um… Uh, but quickly, as soon as it disengages from the rest of the heated metal, it cools, and so there's, like, these little… Um, globules of, uh… solid, like, reformed metal floating through the…

[GM] 22:00:29
atmosphere. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:00:31
I thought you were gonna tell us about the non-teamsters didn't realize it was coming, and…

[GM] 22:00:37
Melted right through their suits into their brains, yeah, yeah.

[GM] 22:00:42
Um… The other thing is, like, you see the… you see the metal eventually, like, go and bounce off the glass of the… Yeah. Um… So yeah, uh, you cut through the locks on the door. Uh, it…

[Ink] 22:00:49
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:50
the console.

[GM] 22:00:59
opens easily after that. Um, within the next room, you see… Uh, let's see… Banks of heavy-duty transformers and flow regulators.

[GM] 22:01:09
All seem to be inert. Um… And, like, that power has been rerouted away, um… And once again, this kind of makes sense, um… Because there's, you know.

[GM] 22:01:25
since the thruster was disengaged. There's no reason to route power down here, because it can't actually.

[GM] 22:01:31
Activate the thruster. Um… so everything's kind of turned off. There's yet another control board.

[GM] 22:01:40
This one does not have a large override button on it, but it has sort of like a… access panel beneath it.

[GM] 22:01:48
Um, if you wanted to go and… dig out its guts.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:56
I want to dig out his guts.

[GM] 22:01:59
Okay, you go over and you open up the… no, you said it, buddy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:00
No, I'm kidding. I don't know what I would do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:03
No!

[GM] 22:02:04
Alright, roll D100. Nope. No, you said, yeah, I want to go with Scots.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:06
No! I said no!

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:10
No, I said no!

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:15
I'm gonna sit down on the floor!

[GM] 22:02:17
You can't… you float over towards there. It's like you can't help yourself but dig out the guts.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:19
No!

[Ink] 22:02:23
Carnoc said you're doing it now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:26
Alright, CardX says, I got nothing else to do, I gotta go dig out the guts.

[GM] 22:02:31
Alright, uh, roll D100.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:35
Um, oh, just D100, not under anything.

[GM] 22:02:39
Yeah, just the 100.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:40
Okay.

[Ink] 22:02:42
Might find goodies.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:44
RD… is it just RD100?

[GM] 22:02:47
slash RD… slash R space D1D100. 1D100.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:48
slash R space D100.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:51
1D100, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:53
Oh my god?

[GM] 22:02:56
32. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:57
32…

[GM] 22:03:03
Alright, you open up the… underneath the panels, uh, inside you find… Uh, grouping of tiny purple crystals.

[Ink] 22:03:15
Ooh, good job. You can ground those up and snort them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:16
Purple crystals…

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:19
Jeez, man, what?

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:24
What the what?!

[GM] 22:03:26
Um…

[Ink] 22:03:28
Those are 1,000 credits apiece!

[GM] 22:03:33
Uh, as you, like… Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:33
Okay. So, can I analyze the crystals, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:37
Or, like, just take a look and see if I recognize them at all, or…

[GM] 22:03:41
You do not recognize these, but as you're sort of like.

[GM] 22:03:44
leaning in to look at them, uh… there's sort of, like, a small light kind of begins to grow.

[GM] 22:03:51
Within that. Uh, they almost, you know. are in some ways reacting.

[GM] 22:03:57
to your presence?

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:58
Oh, interesting.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:02
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:06
Alright, keep talking.

[GM] 22:04:09
That's it. They kind of… you can tell that they react to your presence.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:09
Oh, that's it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:13
Oh, okay.

[Ink] 22:04:21
We'll put those in your pocket.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:26
Sure. Do we have a container of anything, or anything like that that we could put these in, or no?

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:35
I'll just put them in my pocket, then.

[GM] 22:04:37
Okay. Pick up the crystals. Tiny purple crystals, I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:39
How many crystals altogether?

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:46
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:48
They don't look… they're glowing at me.

[GM] 22:04:49
Alright. They're glowing at you, but they're not… nothing else happens. You put them in your pocket, they're still glowing in your pocket.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:53
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:57
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:00
Do you guys sure you guys want me to have this in my…

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:04
Pocket…

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:06
Alright.

[GM] 22:05:10
Okay. Um… These directions are sort of arbitrary, but there's a door to the north and a door to the south.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:14
So, like… Are these crystals, like, part of the normal mechanisms in there, or are they something that's growing at it?

[GM] 22:05:22
No, they are not growing on it. They also are not a part of the normal mechanisms.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:29
They're just hidden in there. Yeah, okay.

[Ink] 22:05:30
It looks like there's stature there, okay.

[GM] 22:05:34
Uh, Murderbot, if you're putting them on your character sheet?

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:36
Oh, yeah.

[GM] 22:05:37
Um, make sure you write down the number 32 next to them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:42
32…

[GM] 22:05:44
Because you'll tell me purple crystals later, and I'll be like, I have no idea what they are.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:45
Hold on.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:47
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Where the heck is my… oh, there it is.

[Ink] 22:05:48
Oh, they're like, you're booking.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:51
No, it's not the number of crystals, it's just a… So you can look them up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:54
It's, like, the option that I rolled.

[GM] 22:05:55
It's the… it's… What'd you roll, yeah.

[Ink] 22:05:55
Fantastic.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:58
So, should I just say Purple Crystals 32?

[GM] 22:06:01
Yes, that'd be fine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:03
Okay.

[Ink] 22:06:06
Well, now I got a title for this picture I just made.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:12
crystals…

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:17
And… a trinket, or other?

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:20
I guess it doesn't matter.

[GM] 22:06:25
Oh, I forgot to ask. Um… What is everybody's trinket?

[Ink] 22:06:33
Mine's a harmonica.

[GM] 22:06:36
Okay. Yeah, say, snake eyes on them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:37
Mine are patched over once!

[Ink] 22:06:40
Oh, thank God. You always wear those everywhere.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:44
I'm patched overalls.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:47
Well, mine is snake whiskey.

[GM] 22:06:50
Snake whisking. Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:06:50
By the interstellar compass pointing to my homeworld.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:54
That's so random!

[GM] 22:07:00
Alright. Um, which store would you like to proceed through? One in the north or one in the south?

[Ink] 22:07:08
So we know that the south one doesn't go anywhere and the north one does, so let's check the south one first.

[GM] 22:07:14
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:14
Why do we know that?

[Ink] 22:07:16
When we look at the map, 60G. Oh, gotcha, you're right, I don't know which one's south or which one's north, you're right.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:22
No, I'm saying, but they… they both go to…

[Ink] 22:07:26
doesn't… are we… we're at 60F and 60G, right? That's the decision we're making right now, GM, or no?

[GM] 22:07:32
During your N61C.

[Ink] 22:07:34
Oh, gotcha. Oh, never mind. Okay, so we're not here near as far as I thought.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:36
Yeah. Well, but they're both 61B, so…

[Ink] 22:07:41
Oh, that's… that's tricky. Well, we can't go wrong, then. South, GM, south. That's my role.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:47
Oh.

[GM] 22:07:47
South. Alright, um, you spend 30 minutes, uh, trying to.

[GM] 22:07:55
traverse this room.

[Ink] 22:08:00
It's always scary when GM rolls.

[GM] 22:08:03
Um, you get to the door, uh… It's, uh… It's a normal door, I don't think it's an airlock.

[GM] 22:08:16
No. It's an airlock door. I guess that kind of makes sense. It's pretty close to the… space. Um… it opens, though, easily, uh, in the next room.

[GM] 22:08:27
Let's see… uh, you see some backup generators. much smaller, and they're all shielded.

[GM] 22:08:37
Meaning that you're pretty sure… They got the nuclear symbol on them, um… So they're just small nuclear reactors in here.

[GM] 22:08:47
Um, there are multiple warnings about, uh, radioactivity, risk of death.

[GM] 22:08:53
You know, there's, like… a guy with a… a gun.

[GM] 22:08:57
like a stick figure with a gun, and it has, like, a red circle around it with a slash through it.

[GM] 22:09:02
It's like, yeah. Don't shoot your guns in here.

[Ink] 22:09:03
Don't shoot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:06
I take a look at… I take a look at the crystals in a pocket as I… if I'm getting closer, any reaction, or no?

[GM] 22:09:08
Um…

[GM] 22:09:13
To the… nope, they glow the same amount of brightness being around you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:17
Okay.

[GM] 22:09:21
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:24
Hey guys! Sorry I'm late.

[Ink] 22:09:27
Hey! Hi.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:27
Zeke!

[Dex Miro] 22:09:28
Ah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:09:29
My symptoms.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:32
I saw Zeke in person.

[GM] 22:09:34
Um… You saw him in person, he's real?

[Ink] 22:09:35
Did you…

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:37
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:38
real. Murderbot…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:40
bought me a super fancy dinner.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:42
I didn't buy you… I didn't buy you Jack, man.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:44
He's awesome.

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:46
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:48
Did you…

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:51
Well, I don't know, we could talk about that later. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:09:55
What's going on? Hey, we are on the ship, er, not the ship, what do we call it? We are on the…

[Ink] 22:10:02
Zeke, if you navigate to the chat, you can see the… depictions are pretty up-to-date.

[GM] 22:10:03
The deep, or…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:08
Alright, let's see…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:18
Wait, the chat in Roll20?

[Ink] 22:10:20
No, not… sorry, not Zoom.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:21
No, in, um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:22
I don't see anything in the chat in Zoom.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:24
In Zoom?

[Ink] 22:10:26
Oh, really? You don't see the history? Oh, that's… that stinks.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:27
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:28
Oh, he doesn't get it because he's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:32
Interesting.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:35
Intresando.

[Ink] 22:10:37
GM, can I share my screen?

[GM] 22:10:41
I have approved sharing of screens.

[Ink] 22:10:45
Alright.

[Ink] 22:10:49
Let's see, oh, my screens are 8K, let me make the smaller one.

[Ink] 22:11:18
You guys see my screen now?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:20
I see it.

[GM] 22:11:20
It's kind of blank, but yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:22
you know.

[Ink] 22:11:23
Alright, so… Start with… let's see, there's not an order, sorry.

[Ink] 22:11:36
Oh, of course, yeah, this picture, but… Um… Alright, so we… took the ship and we docked it to CloudBank.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:47
Okay.

[Ink] 22:11:47
So we left. Um, we had… took a little… we went to floor, um, 6 is where we decided to go.

[Ink] 22:11:55
As we're guided, it looks like it's the place where the bell used to be attached.

[Ink] 22:11:58
Um, because that would… which… the bell is the thruster that was removed from the station, so the station can't really go anywhere.

[Ink] 22:12:05
Um, we went into room 61E, which was giant.

[Ink] 22:12:09
And the only way out of it was… and there was no gravity, so there flow… the first picture didn't have you in it, so I had to add Zeke back in there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:16
Hey, do I have to add Mickey Mouse ears to my sheet?

[Ink] 22:12:18
Uh…

[GM] 22:12:23
No, apparently it's… the function is a liar. It's a liar.

[Ink] 22:12:24
Absolutely. That's right. Can't do it yet.

[Ink] 22:12:28
Um, and then we get to a room, and we see an override panel with a comically large red button on it.

[Ink] 22:12:35
And a suit that was there for, like, a maintenance area. We didn't really mess with that.

[Ink] 22:12:39
And then, ink, use the welder to… burn through a locked airlock so that we could go into the larger room of 61C.

[Ink] 22:12:47
And then the first thing we saw in there was another override pan… or another panel that wasn't override panel, where's that one?

[Ink] 22:12:55
Um… another panel. And… Uh, Murderbot decided that he wanted to open the panel up, and he found crystals.

[Ink] 22:13:05
And he was so excited about the crystals. And he showed them to… oh, where's that? Yeah, he showed them Carnoc, who was not amused.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:14
Very excited.

[Ink] 22:13:17
And that's where we are. Oh, well, actually, we just saw… big room… reactor room with lots of nuclear things, and uh… It says, don't shoot in this room, but I don't have a picture of that yet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:28
Alright, cool.

[Ink] 22:13:29
Totally up to speed.

[GM] 22:13:32
And Zeke, you missed last time that, um, besides Arcady that they met on the bell, they also met a woman named Noriko.

[GM] 22:13:39
And she talks a lot about this… entity called the Minotaur that the.

[GM] 22:13:44
AI on the station. called Monarch, was keeping, um… In a labyrinth?

[GM] 22:13:53
And, uh, the crew convinced Noriko to join them, so… There's a bald-headed woman.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:53
I'm a player.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:00
I was about to ask who that woman was.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:02
So…

[GM] 22:14:04
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:05
is a bit…

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:08
Crazy.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:19
And I just uploaded the map, so if you want to reference that in your browser.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:24
That's…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:26
Alright, cool.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:29
Oh, nice.

[GM] 22:14:36
So yeah, there's a bunch of, uh… nuclear reactors… In here, um… There's still no light?

[GM] 22:14:49
So you guys are guided by, um… No, there might be, like, faint lights coming from the, uh, the reactors themselves.

[GM] 22:14:57
But there's no, like… the room's not fully powered up or anything.

[GM] 22:15:05
I assume most everybody's still wearing either a hazard suit or a back suit of some kind.

[GM] 22:15:11
Even though the picture showed Murderbot running around in just his overalls.

[Ink] 22:15:15
Yeah, it took their suits off for some reason, but I assume so too.

[GM] 22:15:19
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:15:25
It's the Emperor's new suit.

[GM] 22:15:36
Um… So you guys kind of casually float through this space, um… pushing off of, like, various different objects to propel yourselves through the.

[GM] 22:15:46
The atmosphere, um… you get to the next airlock door.

[GM] 22:15:52
sort of east, so to speak, um… And you notice that this one is also locked.

[GM] 22:15:58
Um, once again, easily… You, uh, can be cut through with using the hand welder.

[GM] 22:16:04
Uh, if you so choose.

[Ink] 22:16:08
I'm gonna blast that door open.

[GM] 22:16:11
Alright. And by blast, you mean take your time to cut through, uh, with precision.

[GM] 22:16:17
The, uh, the lock.

[Ink] 22:16:17
Yes. Yes, and Zeke… Zeke, note that you don't want to get too close to these floating globules, they're hot.

[Ink] 22:16:23
they will go right to your brain.

[GM] 22:16:31
Zig seems like he's either fallen asleep or he's paying close attention to one or the other. Who knows?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:16:37
Uh, I haven't fallen asleep.

[GM] 22:16:40
Not yet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:16:42
Uh, yeah, that's probably fair.

[GM] 22:16:46
Um, alright. ink cuts through the locks.

[GM] 22:16:50
Um… the door opens easily after that. Uh, in the next room. And also, you notice that there isn't really, like, any kind of pressure differential.

[GM] 22:17:00
Between the rooms, so there isn't, like, this… which means that you're pretty confident that, um… uh, air… or, sorry, um… life support systems are running equally in all rooms.

[GM] 22:17:16
Um… So after unlocking the store, uh, within you see… Um… this is B.

[GM] 22:17:26
tight spirals of bladed metal curled in organic patterns, puncturing the skin of the station and radiating heat out into nothingness.

[GM] 22:17:35
Um… the, uh… Teamsters are able to tell you that this is, like, essentially cooling ducts.

[GM] 22:17:40
Like, these are, um… What do you call them? They're, like, essentially the fins on your, uh, heat sinks. So… They're, um, using venting heat into the… into space.

[GM] 22:17:52
As a way to keep the, the, um… keep the station from overheating.

[GM] 22:18:00
Um… There are 10 cooling fins.

[GM] 22:18:06
Oh, sorry, there's 5… 5 cooling fins. Based on your knowledge about the station symmetry of the space, you assume there's 5 in the other cooling?

[GM] 22:18:15
Um, duct area. Um…

[GM] 22:18:25
Uh, I guess I need to know… is everyone wearing a vac suit, or are people wearing a mix of vac suits and, um… Uh, hazard seats.

[GM] 22:18:37
Who's wearing a vac suit?

[Ink] 22:18:40
We've gone over this before…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:43
Don't we all have to be wearing vac suits? Because we needed to…

[Ink] 22:18:45
Yeah, but which one? Vac suit or hazard suit? I have a hazard suit on.

[GM] 22:18:50
Okay. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:51
I have a hazard suit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:18:55
Anybody wearing a back suit? I don't know.

[Ink] 22:18:59
I think you want to hazards. Hazard Suit has more protection from radiation, right?

[GM] 22:19:04
Yeah, let's see. Uh, both have… Radiation shielding.

[GM] 22:19:10
Um…

[GM] 22:19:15
the Vac suit has… Uh, headlamps, and… I guess, yeah, the, um… Hazard does as well. Hold on one second.

[GM] 22:20:05
Okay, um, both have short-range comms. Um… hazard suit… has… What?

[GM] 22:20:19
One hour of oxygen versus 12 hours of oxygen with the fact suit.

[GM] 22:20:26
Um… Vac suit offers 3 points of armor.

[GM] 22:20:33
Versus the 5 of… The hazard suit… The hazards it gives you… Hydro reclamation.

[Ink] 22:20:45
I mean, you can pee in your suit.

[GM] 22:20:46
You can pee in your suit, and it cleans it for you.

[GM] 22:20:50
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:51
Gotta have that, then.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:54
And it takes long to move around this station, GM's gonna have us be doing bladder rolls soon.

[GM] 22:20:59
True.

[Ink] 22:20:59
That's right.

[GM] 22:21:06
Um… Yeah. You know, they're very, very similar. Um… The hazard suit's maybe just designed a little bit more for, like.

[GM] 22:21:15
extraterrestrial. Um… navigation, whereas the vaccine's more designed for… Be in space.

[GM] 22:21:30
The hazard suit says that it's got extreme heat and cold, but I'm like, shouldn't the Vac suit have at least extreme cold? Like… production.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:35
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:21:39
No, the real question, though, is GM, why are you asking?

[GM] 22:21:44
Well, in case you guys get to, uh… Well, it's… well, it's easy to answer. So, you notice.

[GM] 22:21:53
Um, uh, that the room does heat up. every once in a while, um… He comes from some other place in the, um, station, and travels through these fins, and then is conducted out into space. And so, for those brief moments.

[GM] 22:22:11
Um, the room gets extremely hot. Uh, but if you have some sort of barrier, which I'll just assume the vac suit can handle that as well.

[GM] 22:22:21
Um… you're okay in traversing this room.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:30
Sorry, are we in 61A now, or are we still in 61B?

[GM] 22:22:34
You're in 61A. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:37
Hey, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:49
So we're… so we're fine in the VEX with 10 attitude.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:52
Yeah.

[GM] 22:22:52
Yep.

[Ink] 22:22:54
Hey, Zeke, note that the AI gets into your head, is what we were warned, and so weird things might happen.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:55
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:23:00
In your head.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:23:03
I'm used to that by now, right? Because, uh…

[Ink] 22:23:05
That's right. You should, you have some immunity to that. You built up resistance.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:23:06
I already have AI in my head.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:23:10
I should have, like, some protection.

[Ink] 22:23:20
you'll know what it feels when the mechanical being seeps in.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:27
Yes, we can cross.

[GM] 22:23:30
Okay. You. spend 30 minutes traversing.

[GM] 22:23:36
Uh, this room…

[GM] 22:23:45
Um…

[Ink] 22:23:49
We're going low today, GM. Oh, this one, D10s, never mind. D100.

[GM] 22:23:52
Yeah, just intense. Um… a few of the times where, you know, you sense the heat increase in the room, maybe you have, like, a little sensor in your… Um, in your suit that…

[GM] 22:24:06
warns you, but you don't really feel anything. Um, the fins in the rooms kind of… Uh, give off that kind of, like.

[GM] 22:24:15
shimmering effect from, you know, a lot of heat being poured through, so… Um… but it dissipates quickly.

[GM] 22:24:25
You get to the airlock, um… leading north, and open that up.

[GM] 22:24:32
Um, inside… Uh, you see… Narrow inspection clamber ways.

[GM] 22:24:41
clamber ways. above a shielded nuclear core.

[GM] 22:24:47
So this… this is effectively the, um… Basically, they're, like, a bunch of, like, criss-crossing, um, catwalks.

[GM] 22:24:57
Um… and they're all surrounding this core, nuclear core.

[GM] 22:25:02
Um, this is… well, you could tell to be the main power generator for the station.

[GM] 22:25:07
So… whereas the other generators were, like, backup generators, like, maybe keeping life support on for a short period of time.

[GM] 22:25:16
This is the space that powers the entire ship.

[GM] 22:25:20
Um…

[Ink] 22:25:23
I was an entire ship, huh?

[GM] 22:25:25
the power entire station, I should say.

[GM] 22:25:30
Um, so this room is huge, and this reactor is huge itself.

[GM] 22:25:35
Um, you know, think of, like, uh… you know, essentially… the necessary power generation for, like, a big city, and this is… kind of what you're looking at.

[Ink] 22:25:48
So, do we think that the AI needs. this power to run.

[GM] 22:25:55
Um… Probably. Um… Yeah.

[Ink] 22:26:01
Is there a giant red button that would turn it off?

[Ink] 22:26:02
Or is that the giant rebut we maybe saw before?

[GM] 22:26:07
Um… There is an… or there's a, um, inspection window, which you suspect is, like, on the other side, that might be some controls for it.

[GM] 22:26:21
Um… Yeah. You might find something in there.

[Ink] 22:26:29
Can I investigate that?

[GM] 22:26:30
Yeah, okay. You go in there, um, and… First thing you notice in the room is painted across the… wall is a phrase.

[GM] 22:26:42
The frog in the well cannot conceive of the ocean.

[GM] 22:26:48
Um… Besides that, there are a number of control panels.

[GM] 22:26:55
Um… These do not seem powered down in any particular way, they seem operational.

[GM] 22:27:04
Um…

[GM] 22:27:08
There is… there is an option to… No, that's… it's just written.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:09
Is the phrase written in anything? Unusual.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:14
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

[GM] 22:27:16
I mean, it's painted. It's not… it wasn't, like… printed on a decal or anything.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:22
Okay.

[GM] 22:27:24
Um… Yeah, there's… there… you can… you could probably shut down the generator from here.

[GM] 22:27:30
Um…

[Ink] 22:27:33
Can I jerry something that would allow me to remotely shut it down?

[GM] 22:27:38
Sure.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:41
That sounds like something you're good at, so go for it.

[Ink] 22:27:43
Yeah.

[GM] 22:27:48
That one you will… you will need to roll that.

[Ink] 22:27:49
Because I have… plus 15% jerry rigging.

[GM] 22:27:54
Uh, I presume this would be an intelligence.

[Ink] 22:27:58
Until, oh, I just clicked on your… Does that make sense?

[GM] 22:28:02
Oh, yeah, I mean, I thought the way it works is you… do… um… like, if you select a skill, it'll add the bonus.

[Ink] 22:28:13
I clicked on jury rigging, and so then it just took me… said normal, or… Advantage-disadvantage.

[GM] 22:28:14
To, uh…

[Ink] 22:28:19
Or normal. than attribute intelligence, okay, gotcha, that's what you're saying. Okay, so intellect… I just hadn't gotten that far. No macro options.

[GM] 22:28:21
This is just normal.

[GM] 22:28:26
Yeah.

[GM] 22:28:32
Nope. Okay. Alright.

[GM] 22:28:37
You spend… probably, like. 20 minutes, um… Wherein you're putting together, um… you find some components to basically put together, like, a small… radio transmitter… Um… tie it into your shortwave comms.

[GM] 22:29:02
And I'll allow you to… Essentially, turn off the generator if you so.

[GM] 22:29:08
So, choose.

[Ink] 22:29:10
I'm gonna make it turn back on, right?

[GM] 22:29:13
Sure. That's what… that's what you think.

[Ink] 22:29:15
I grow the field. Early 52, who knows?

[Ink] 22:29:22
So did I cut myself while I did it? What's the penalty for my 52?

[GM] 22:29:26
No, no, you got underneath, you succeeded. You rolled a 37.

[Ink] 22:29:30
Oh, I wrote a 37, my card was 50.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:31
Yeah, your role's the 37. I know you're not used to seeing a target as high as 52, that's the problem.

[Ink] 22:29:34
Yeah, I just did, uh… I haven't hit the missing. Bad things happen.

[Ink] 22:29:51
No, you can't roll anymore, GM, stop.

[GM] 22:29:59
Uh, out of this room, there's a door to the north, and then there's a door to the east.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:13
But, so what… is this considered part of 60H still, or…

[GM] 22:30:18
The… the doors out of it? Yeah, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:19
Like, the control room that we're in, or…

[GM] 22:30:22
the entirety of 60H is, like, the reactor itself, all the catwalks, and, like, the control room that.

[GM] 22:30:29
8 to 1 and 2. Or I should say ink 1 and 2.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:43
North and the east.

[Ink] 22:30:53
But decide which way we want to go. Sorry, which room are we in?

[Dex Miro] 22:30:54
Well… I don't… I don't know.

[Ink] 22:30:57
You don't know which room we're in.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:59
I mean, we're in 60H, but I don't know why anything would be saying east.

[Ink] 22:31:04
East should take us… out to 60 EF or 60G, maybe, to that quarter.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:10
Oh, that's true, yes, you're correct. So…

[Ink] 22:31:10
The passageway? If we wanted to finish with 61A, and maybe we'd want to go north?

[Ink] 22:31:17
There might be more purple crystals.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:21
I don't know if I want to… I would add, like, 2 hours, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:31:25
Wait, weren't the crystals in 61C?

[Ink] 22:31:28
Yeah, Crystal was 61C, I'm just joking, there might be more… I think that, I don't know, it seemed like, so far.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:32
Doc.

[Ink] 22:31:34
you got somewhere to be, Dex?

[Dex Miro] 22:31:38
I mean, this is gonna take us days, and I wanna get off the station as soon as I can.

[Ink] 22:31:46
I wanna… this is what I… this is what I came onto space for. It's fighting purple crystals and jerry-rigging things.

[GM] 22:31:53
I mean, you've already been here two and a half hours.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:56
We don't know what these things do!

[GM] 22:31:59
But they glow next to you.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:00
Like… There's… there's so many weird things, we don't know anything about on the station, and… I don't know what this Minotaur is, but… The way she smiles about it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:01
It doesn't mean anything?

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:14
Oh, and we didn't ask?

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:15
Crazy lady, if she knows what these are?

[GM] 22:32:18
The crystals? She doesn't know what the crystals are.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:19
It's right here.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:24
Sure, she doesn't.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:28
And we have yet to run into any Android so far.

[Ink] 22:32:33
As far as we know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:35
Oh, they could be, like, looking at us through…

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:38
security?

[Ink] 22:32:38
Yeah, I mean, you could be… Which we scanned, we scanned.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:39
That woman could be an android, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:41
Well, no, we scanned her, we scanned her, she's…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:44
I can't recall.

[Ink] 22:32:45
She doesn't have a stamp that says genuine human meat, but.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:45
We have a scanner, we have an Android scanner.

[Ink] 22:32:51
Our certified human.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:54
Unless they gave us a faulty scanner.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:55
Alex showed you what he would meet. It doesn't… it doesn't group your overtone.

[Ink] 22:33:00
I think that's with their stamp on you now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:01
Hi.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:03
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:33:04
Okay. GM, we don't… do we have a time crunch that we know of?

[GM] 22:33:12
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:13
No, just the…

[Ink] 22:33:13
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:14
Not that yet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:16
the… the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:18
The threat is…

[Ink] 22:33:19
I'd like to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:20
Us being found out, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:23
God knows what they'll do to us.

[Ink] 22:33:23
Yeah. I'd like to explore 61A and 6… Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:25
But, a frog in a well…

[Ink] 22:33:32
Are we in the well? Uh, I'd like to go north, I guess, but I understand what you're saying, Dex.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:36
But that's just gonna take us… like, we can… we can hit that on the way out.

[Ink] 22:33:41
Yeah, but if we hadn't come through the South Park here, and I set up my jerry rig, we wouldn't be able to turn off the power and threaten the AI later.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:50
No, we've… we were gonna go to 60H either way, that's where you set up the tray rigging.

[Ink] 22:33:55
Got you. Well, you go to… are you gonna plan on going to 6G?

[Dex Miro] 22:33:56
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:03
I mean, it's a relatively small detour, so I could be persuaded.

[Ink] 22:34:13
We have comms, right, GM?

[GM] 22:34:15
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:15
We're not splitting up.

[Ink] 22:34:20
Okay… Never know what treasures lie in 61A North.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:25
We can't. It's just too far, it's not like we can dull back and get there in time.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:31
One thing bad happens, and you're just… you're on your own, you're fucked.

[Ink] 22:34:35
Okay, and I do have the welder.

[GM] 22:34:39
Okay. Which direction do you guys go?

[Ink] 22:34:42
East.

[Dex Miro] 22:34:43
East.

[GM] 22:34:44
Okay. Do you open the airlock, uh, you enter into a corridor.

[GM] 22:34:49
Um, there are small handholds on the wall to… since there's no gravity in the sit… this area, uh, for you to push yourselves along to.

[GM] 22:34:57
Uh, you get to, uh, uh… T-intersection, uh, you can head south, or you can head north.

[Ink] 22:35:07
Dex as we get closer.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:07
We can go look at 61 or 60G.

[GM] 22:35:12
You turned the corner, head south. Um, you go to a… This is not an airlock.

[GM] 22:35:21
This is a… Regular office door.

[GM] 22:35:27
Um, it opens easily enough into… 60G. Banks of readout displays and monitoring stations.

[GM] 22:35:37
Um…

[GM] 22:35:42
There appear to be newly built metal air duct grills.

[GM] 22:35:47
So, like, around the ventilation, uh, there's been newly installed.

[GM] 22:35:53
metal, uh, grills. Uh, additionally, you see some monitoring stations.

[GM] 22:35:59
The report on the power generation and distribution. Um, so this is more of, like.

[GM] 22:36:04
you would have someone sort of sitting in here, uh.

[GM] 22:36:08
maintaining a readout on the power generation, but… Um, and if they wanted to or needed to go into the power generator.

[GM] 22:36:16
room, they could, you know, try to adjust issues there.

[GM] 22:36:20
Um… Anyone have the engineering skill?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:27
I might.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:31
I have.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:32
Does seem like you would if anybody was going to.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:35
Oh, I might just be biology. I always think I'm, like, a scientist that has, like, a diversity of skills, and it turns out I just know about

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:42
biology.

[Ink] 22:36:44
with jerry rigging instead.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:46
I've got computers!

[GM] 22:36:49
Is… well, let me ask this question differently since this is a different version of the game. Is engineering a skill on your character sheet?

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:56
Yeah, it's under expert.

[Ink] 22:36:56
It is. It's right next to Jerry Rigging.

[GM] 22:36:57
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:37:02
So, in the Zoom call with a bunch of engineers, no one has engineering.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:08
this is accurate.

[GM] 22:37:11
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:12
Why are some things… I don't remember. Are some things bold and some things checked? Why are some things bold and some things checked?

[GM] 22:37:17
That's an excellent question.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:18
checks what I have.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:19
Bold means you meet the prerequisites, but you don't have it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:21
Okay.

[Ink] 22:37:22
Yeah, and if they're grayed out, you don't meet the prerequisites, I guess I'd assume.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:26
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:27
you know, for this sheet.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:27
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:28
Which is not the actual…

[Ink] 22:37:30
So you, you have probably have access to engineering?

[Ink] 22:37:33
But you don't have it checked, Zeke? That's it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:35
Yeah, I actually… I don't even think that one's bold. I have physics as bold, but not checked.

[Ink] 22:37:40
Oh, okay. Yeah, I have ops… I could have picked engineering, but I went jar-rigging instead.

[Ink] 22:37:46
Or jury rigging. I always think it's Jerry.

[GM] 22:37:52
Um, well, regardless, there's a bunch of readouts. Uh, I'll run the monitoring stations.

[Ink] 22:38:02
But we have no clue what they mean. Yeah.

[GM] 22:38:05
Well, do you take time to read them? Alright. Uh, you determined that the data must be falsified or old based on the way the deep currently looks.

[GM] 22:38:15
So essentially, um… Like, it says, like, you know.

[GM] 22:38:21
The power generation's fine, all systems are go, like, but… That would imply that, like, uh, it should be… lit in this office, and the lights are not on.

[GM] 22:38:33
Um, so there's some… something… different between these readouts and the current situation.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:42
What are there, Dr. Grills is over? Like, there's just a lot of ventilation that's in this room.

[GM] 22:38:48
Yeah, so, like, normally, if the station were operational the way it's supposed to be, someone would be sitting in this room.

[GM] 22:38:55
watching readouts on the power generation, and so the metal air ducts.

[GM] 22:39:00
are for ventilation into the room, and the grills are just, like, the things that, like.

[GM] 22:39:05
Prevent, you know, someone from flying up. immediately into the air duct and or objects floating up in there and getting it all busted up in the ventilation.

[Ink] 22:39:14
So, since they're new, it sounds like somebody removed the previous ones, maybe went in there?

[Ink] 22:39:19
and then replace them? I want to remove the new ones.

[GM] 22:39:21
Yeah, probably. Okay.

[Ink] 22:39:27
And check in there.

[GM] 22:39:28
Um… Make a… is a speed a saving throw?

[GM] 22:39:35
Or speed a… What are the saving throws? No, the saving throws are body… Sanity and fear.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:41
Sanity, fear, armor.

[GM] 22:39:45
Um, do a body saving throw.

[Ink] 22:39:54
Normal. No modifiers. Yeah.

[GM] 22:39:57
Yeah.

[GM] 22:40:06
Okay. Um, alright, you lift up the grill.

[GM] 22:40:15
Um… and… for some reason, um… like, I don't know if you just… accidentally jam it, or what, but.

[GM] 22:40:25
There… you hear the sound of, like. Just, like, the thinnest of glass breaking.

[GM] 22:40:32
Um… And… Uh, you see this… sort of green gas quickly dissipate into the atmosphere around you.

[GM] 22:40:47
Um… I suspect that that… You're not sure what it was, um.

[GM] 22:40:53
you get some warning signs in your hazard suit, saying that, uh… Toxin has been detected.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:00
Oh, boy.

[GM] 22:41:03
Um, but because you're wearing a hazard suit, it doesn't affect you.

[Ink] 22:41:09
So it was, like, booby trapped.

[GM] 22:41:12
It feels like a booby trap. And you're the booby.

[Dex Miro] 22:41:12
Your symptoms.

[Ink] 22:41:26
Interesting. Okay, so I survived the booby trap, and now… I can check and… see what's beyond the grill.

[GM] 22:41:36
Yeah. Um, Beyond the Grill is… just an air duct. I mean, it's just like, you know, a ventilation shaft.

[Dex Miro] 22:41:38
So what is that?

[Dex Miro] 22:41:44
So this is something that a human can fit inside of, though?

[GM] 22:41:49
Um, yeah, it'd be tight, though, and honestly, with your hazard suits.

[GM] 22:41:54
Um, you'd be a little bit worried that they'd maybe… cause you to not be able to fit too well? Like, you don't know if you'd be able to move too easily through them.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:01
Um…

[Ink] 22:42:07
So if I shine my flashlight down there, I just see.

[Ink] 22:42:11
has a shaft.

[GM] 22:42:13
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:42:20
Hmm. I wish I had a little robot, like, if I could drive down there.

[Ink] 22:42:29
Remotely see. I don't have one of those. Did you have a robot that did that?

[Dex Miro] 22:42:31
Do I still have that? No, I never had that. You just had that before.

[Ink] 22:42:37
I did.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:39
Didn't you? Maybe somebody else did, I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:41
I don't think anybody had a…

[Ink] 22:42:43
Oh, that's right, I do have something like that. That's the, uh, bug.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:48
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:42:50
Where's my, uh…

[Ink] 22:42:54
But I think it's a listening device, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:43:01
Oh, couldn't… can I not move, you have to slap it on something?

[Ink] 22:43:04
I forget, um… Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:07
No, it's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:09
What do you mean?

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:11
a bug?

[Ink] 22:43:13
Yeah, I had a book. I think so, because I put it on the… I was able to listen to the, uh… the captain or whatever, or the CEO on that remember?

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:15
Are you sure?

[Ink] 22:43:25
No, we blew up.

[Ink] 22:43:37
Shoot.

[Ink] 22:43:42
I got a looky-boo, God mode… A box box… No, I don't have the box.

[Ink] 22:43:49
feedback. What did I use to do that? A cattle tail. That's what it must have been.

[Ink] 22:43:57
Detachable audio surveillance bug, which can be traced up to 100 kilometers.

[Ink] 22:44:02
Within a 100-meter area.

[Ink] 22:44:08
So, yeah, it was just a surveillance… the audio surveillance, so that wouldn't help me.

[Ink] 22:44:16
Unless I jerry-rig it.

[GM] 22:44:19
Hmm.

[Ink] 22:44:26
Bummer, that's what I should have been spending my downtime on, is… upgrading my tattle tale so that it had a camera.

[Ink] 22:44:35
Alright, so the risk, if I go down here, because I'm afraid I'm going to get stuck.

[Ink] 22:44:40
And if I take off my suit, is the, uh, poison still in the air?

[GM] 22:44:40
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:45
Probably.

[GM] 22:44:48
Yeah, it's… that's a risk.

[Ink] 22:44:53
Ah, there's something really good in those air vents that somebody's hiding, I guess, like.

[Ink] 22:44:58
Dex said, we'll come back for it later.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:01
Is the airflow in this room really strong? Like, do we think it would dissipate pretty fast?

[GM] 22:45:06
Uh, no. Like, if the… if it were very strong, you would… you would probably feel it, just in terms of it moving you.

[GM] 22:45:14
bodily, because of the lack of gravity, but. It is not that strong.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:15
Yeah. Oh, this is true.

[Ink] 22:45:23
Okay, I'm gonna keep my hazard seat on. And… I will, uh, I guess set the grate back in place.

[GM] 22:45:31
Okay.

[Ink] 22:45:41
with the economic plan's not hitting up in there.

[GM] 22:45:43
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 22:45:58
If we're ready to head north?

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:03
Yes.

[GM] 22:46:03
Okay. Alright, you travel back down the hallway, um, into… The corridor can explore just yet, and you get to another office door.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:04
Yeah.

[GM] 22:46:16
Um, you open that door. And… You see… let's see, 60F… Controls for the routing of power through the station.

[GM] 22:46:31
Um, however, the control boards do not appear to be lit up.

[GM] 22:46:36
Um, but they're quite obvious what they're used for.

[GM] 22:46:40
You also see… Um, kind of strung through… Out this room. And it's a relatively small room, it's not, like, big like the big industrial rooms that you've been going through.

[GM] 22:46:52
These glittering threads of steel web. Um, they're all over the panels, so the panels are not only… like, have no power running to them, at least by what you can see.

[GM] 22:47:04
They also are covered in these steel thread blebs.

[GM] 22:47:09
Um… There's numerous panels, switches, and dials on the control panels.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:18
You said steel thread webs.

[GM] 22:47:20
Mm-hmm. Or at least it looks like steel. You go up to it.

[GM] 22:47:25
Um… it's probably… Let's say, uh… A centimeter thick?

[GM] 22:47:35
maybe a little bit more? Um… Yeah.

[Ink] 22:47:47
That doesn't look like it's the original design. To have steel webs across all this stuff.

[GM] 22:47:52
No, no, no, no.

[Ink] 22:47:56
Now, do we see steel webbing like this before in the bell?

[GM] 22:48:01
No.

[Ink] 22:48:02
Okay. Where do we see… we had saw a webbing somewhere before, right? Was that… that on our first mission with the Carcs? Or the… Terex, whatever the thing was. Carcs.

[GM] 22:48:12
Yes, this looks different, though. This… that looked more organic, kind of like glue, and this looks more… Metallic.

[Ink] 22:48:15
Okay.

[Ink] 22:48:21
Interesting. And so then it kind of… The block's access to these control panels?

[GM] 22:48:30
Um… Yeah, I mean, it's… it's… you could flip the switches or push the buttons, but you're… end up like, you know, having to negotiate around the webs, and good chance that, like, if you flip a switch, it'll probably.

[GM] 22:48:42
touch the one of the webs a little bit, at least.

[GM] 22:48:46
Um… Yeah, it's not necessarily… you could… you could definitely interact with the control panel if you wanted, it's just… You'll probably end up interacting with the, uh… with the webs as well.

[Ink] 22:48:57
Webs and the giant. Metal spider will come eat us.

[GM] 22:49:01
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:02
Do we think this could be, like, maybe? The androids made a bunch of connections to this so they could control it or something.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:11
I don't… like, remotely.

[GM] 22:49:15
No, it doesn't look like it's placed in such an orderly fashion as to be able to.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:18
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:49:20
Handle that kind of input.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:22
So it's not organic, but it kind of is… Random, like… Something organic would have made.

[GM] 22:49:28
Yeah. Uh… Uh, Zeke would tell you that this is… it also does not follow.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:31
Just not organic materials.

[GM] 22:49:39
The, uh, traditional biological output of, like, a spider.

[GM] 22:49:43
It was like… yes, it looks like webbing, but spiders typically have patterns that they.

[GM] 22:49:50
build into their webs, and this does not follow that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:49:52
And I am an expert on spiders, so…

[GM] 22:49:55
He's… he is the resident expert on spiders.

[Ink] 22:50:01
We're not gonna… we're gonna avoid touching the web. Do we think it would warn somebody of something, or, uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:50:03
Good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:05
Probably, that's how webs work.

[Ink] 22:50:11
So we… we make extra careful not to touch the web.

[GM] 22:50:15
Are you interacting with the… the panel?

[Ink] 22:50:17
No, I already bypassed it way back before.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:22
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:50:22
Your symptoms.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:26
I'm guessing it's kind of a robotic… it's a robotic spider or something, no?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:32
No? I don't know.

[Ink] 22:50:37
Either that or some warning system for… the AI, who knows?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:42
Yeah…

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:44
But then again, it's like… I mean, there's plenty other ways than to have it, like,

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:50
show…

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:51
out in front.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:55
That…

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:58
Right? It's like out in the open, like, there's no…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:02
Like, it's like…

[GM] 22:51:03
Yeah, it's not… it's not hidden.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:04
Not… not tempting you, but it's just like, hey…

[GM] 22:51:09
Well, it sounds like it's tempting you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:11
Tempting me? Well, it's kind of. I'm just a curious kind of person.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:17
Um… I'm sorry, curious kind of Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:24
GM, I just… I mean, I know I had this before, but I have a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:29
A looky-loo that can pick up transmissions on all non-encrypted bands. Do I hear anything?

[Ink] 22:51:35
That's good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:35
If I monitor…

[GM] 22:51:39
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:40
Any transmissions going on?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:41
around us, or anything like that.

[GM] 22:51:48
No, not as of right now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:49
Um, I take out…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:53
Look at Crystal and put it closer to the webbing? Does it do anything?

[GM] 22:51:59
Mm-mm. No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:59
Okay. Um, I… I ask…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:04
Psychopath, hey, have you seen something like this before?

[GM] 22:52:08
Uh, crystals or the webbing?

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:10
The webbing. Oh, we already asked her about the crystal, she said she'd do it, oh.

[GM] 22:52:14
Yeah. Uh, she also doesn't know about this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:20
No one knows a goddamn thing!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:52:24
I know about spiders.

[Ink] 22:52:25
Ah. This is not spiders.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:27
You know about spiders, or you don't know about spiders?

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:32
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:34
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:37
Well then.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:39
I'd say we keep moving.

[Ink] 22:52:41
Sounds good to me.

[GM] 22:52:47
The exit out of this. a relatively small room is another airlock.

[GM] 22:52:53
This one is locked.

[Ink] 22:52:58
like a blowtorch.

[GM] 22:53:00
Okay.

[GM] 22:53:08
Alright, you power up the blowtorch? Um… You begin cutting through, um… the lock… You're able to complete that.

[GM] 22:53:25
Um… tour swings open, uh, you see a corridor ahead of you.

[GM] 22:53:32
Um… it kind of terminates at. Uh, another airlock… Right, no? Wait.

[Ink] 22:53:40
Right, 60E?

[GM] 22:53:42
Yeah. Is this the…

[GM] 22:53:50
Oh, no, okay.

[GM] 22:53:54
Can't tell if this is…

[Ink] 22:53:56
So 60s like to airlock in between. 60D and 60F.

[GM] 22:54:00
Yeah, but it's actually a space. Um… So, it's a reinforced airlock covered in safety flyers.

[Ink] 22:54:03
Okay.

[GM] 22:54:11
There are 3 lockers.

[GM] 22:54:16
Um, they don't have anything written on them. Oh, no, to have faulty stickers on them.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:27
These faulty stickers?

[GM] 22:54:29
Yeah, sticker that kind of identifies it. The locker is being faulty.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:36
Like, this is just, like, a locker that you keep stuff in, though, right?

[GM] 22:54:41
Yeah.

[GM] 22:54:51
Um, you can continue down the pathway, though, moving ahead.

[GM] 22:54:56
Uh, you see that there are these metal… webs, once again, crisscrossing the, uh… The corridor.

[Ink] 22:55:07
They don't block our way, or do they?

[GM] 22:55:09
They don't entirely block your way, but. It will take a bit of skill to navigate around them without touching them.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:17
Are we still in a zero-G environment? Oh, no.

[GM] 22:55:18
You are in a zero-g environment. That's… that's fine for you, but oh no, for some scientists, perhaps.

[Ink] 22:55:27
It was spider-loving scientists.

[GM] 22:55:33
And one Noriko that you brought with you.

[Ink] 22:55:36
Shoot. Since or donate to… I couldn't fit. I'm sure she's tiny.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:49
Um, but… so… Can we look in the lockers?

[Ink] 22:55:53
I think we want to look at lockers.

[GM] 22:55:54
Okay. You open up, uh… Do you want to open up a faulty locker, or do you want to open up a non-faulty locker?

[Ink] 22:56:02
How many… there's 3 lockers total, and 2 of them are faulty.

[GM] 22:56:03
Yep. Two of them say faulty on them.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:06
I just don't understand how a locker can be faulty, and then it doesn't lock.

[Ink] 22:56:10
I think it's just to try to get you not to open it, because there's gonna be treasure in it.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:10
So…

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:16
You're so gonna die.

[GM] 22:56:19
So, which one do you open? Faulty or non-faulty.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:21
Oh my dear god.

[Ink] 22:56:30
I'll open the non-faulty.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:31
Faulty.

[GM] 22:56:32
Alright, Zeke is opening up a faulty one, and… And, uh, Ink is opening up a non-faulty one.

[GM] 22:56:39
Inside, Ink Finds. a pair of rubber grounding… or, sorry, not a pair, a rubber grounding suit.

[GM] 22:56:50
Uh… and. Who did I say that was Ink or Zeke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:53
Ink.

[GM] 22:56:54
Alright, Zeke finds a rubber grounding suit.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:58
for the same thing.

[Ink] 22:57:00
But his is glowing green or something cool.

[GM] 22:57:05
One might be faulty, one might not be.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:07
What's a rubber grounding suit?

[GM] 22:57:10
Uh, if you were to be in an area of.

[GM] 22:57:14
What? High electricity? It would, you know, it wouldn't arc through your body.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:16
Oh, okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:18
Gotcha. Grounding.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:21
Now I get it.

[GM] 22:57:22
Grounding suit, yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:24
Oh, I feel like the other faulty locker is also going to contain a rubber grounding suit.

[Ink] 22:57:28
No, there's only one way to find out, Dex.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:29
But we should… we should take the rubber grounding suit.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:32
That's not faulty with us.

[GM] 22:57:38
Um… who's going to carry it?

[Dex Miro] 22:57:41
I don't know, how annoying is it to carry?

[GM] 22:57:44
Pretty annoying. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:57:50
It's not, like, something that we could put on over… The hazard suit or vac suit, right?

[GM] 22:57:54
No. It's effectively a wetsuit.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:56
Hey, I already got a sensor on my back, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:02
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:58:03
We're right back, guys.

[Ink] 22:58:04
sort of thinking about the one in the… the locker that says faulty is probably faulty.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:11
There were two faulty, right? Yeah, so the only one that's good is the one Zeke opened.

[Ink] 22:58:12
Yeah.

[GM] 22:58:13
Doom's a faulty.

[Ink] 22:58:19
No, the incognit. Zcopen a faulty locker.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:23
Oh, you're right. Sorry, you're going first and did the non-faulty, yeah.

[Ink] 22:58:28
Can we open the third locker, GM?

[GM] 22:58:30
There is a rubber grounding suit inside.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:34
Why do I feel like we all need to be wearing these rubber grounding suits?

[Ink] 22:58:38
Well, I think you're supposed to wear it when you're going back to the other place that we just came through, right? This, you know…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:44
I don't know, I'm just wondering if, like. Maybe we could put it up against the… Like, between us and the webbing, so in case we did rush it, maybe it wouldn't trigger something.

[Ink] 22:58:53
Ooh, I like that. Let's use the faulty one.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:56
But wait a… wait, why would you use the faulty one?

[Ink] 22:58:56
To do that. I think it's just faulty, like, you'll die in it, but it would still, you know, have some insulating properties. I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:06
I don't know. Yeah, let's… let's use the not faulty one. The question is just… Do we keep taking it with us after this room or not?

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:08
faulty means! Faulty, bro!

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:12
It don't work!

[Ink] 22:59:13
Hi, how you doing?

[Dex Miro] 22:59:17
Because it's obnoxious, but…

[GM] 22:59:20
Yeah, it doesn't fold up easily. Unless you have space to be able to store, essentially, like… Um… a medium object?

[GM] 22:59:31
Um, you're not gonna really be able to carry it with you. I mean, you can carry it, it's just, like, you… if you're wielding a, um… pulse rifle, you won't be able to aim properly with the pulse rifle.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:33
My pleasure.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:41
Yeah, that makes sense. I meant to put on all my items, whether they were small, medium, and large, but I didn't, I don't remember.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:50
So…

[GM] 22:59:52
If you want to list off what you have, I can quickly tell you.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:58
Um… What does the hazard suit itself count as a large item?

[GM] 23:00:03
Technically, yes, but not while you're wearing it.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:07
Okay. Then I have a Vibechete.

[GM] 23:00:11
That's medium.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:14
My trusty spanner. I have some false rifle with large.

[GM] 23:00:16
That's awesome medium. Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:22
Impacts.

[GM] 23:00:23
Those are small.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:28
Um, my auto mode. Probably small.

[GM] 23:00:32
Probably small.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:34
Okay. So then… What could we have, like… One large, two mediums, then four smalls or something, I forget.

[GM] 23:00:43
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:44
Okay, so this is a large item.

[GM] 23:00:48
And large means not, like, counting the one you're wearing.

[GM] 23:00:51
But yeah, this is a large item, effectively.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:53
Okay, so I would have to, like, drop my pulse rifle.

[GM] 23:00:57
No, you wouldn't have to drop it. You could carry it in one hand, you just wouldn't be able to aim effectively with it.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:03
Oh, okay, I see. That's all the stuff that we can… Like, the one large 2BD and four small is what you can carry without being encumbered in some way.

[GM] 23:01:12
Right, right.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:13
Okay. Alright, well, I'll drag it along with me for now, but I'm gonna suggest that, like.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:18
People use it and kind of… We'll hold it between the person going past the whipping and the webbing, and pass it to the next person or something.

[Ink] 23:01:25
And you and I should be better at zero-g.

[Ink] 23:01:29
Right, Dex, so… Dexneaker, you have…

[Dex Miro] 23:01:32
Alright, so yeah, that's… that's a good idea. Why don't we have, like, one of us on each side trying to, like, guide people through it?

[Ink] 23:01:37
Oh, I like that. Okay.

[GM] 23:01:44
Okay, so the team is going to try and traverse the hallway with the webbing across it.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:49
Yeah, it wasn't clear, like, how long it goes down the corridor. I don't know how problematic this is gonna be, but… We gotta try to get through.

[GM] 23:01:56
Well, yeah, we're just gonna make… essentially, everyone's gonna make a check.

[GM] 23:01:59
To go through. Um… And because, uh… Ink… and ducks are.

[GM] 23:02:09
assisting, everyone has advantage going through this. So… everyone, including Noriko.

[GM] 23:02:17
Needs to make a… is it 0G? Is that the skill?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:02:23
I just got back, what are we rolling?

[GM] 23:02:27
a 0G… I think it's 0G is the skill.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:30
There is a skill called ZeroG.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:02:31
Yeah.

[GM] 23:02:32
Yeah, 0G skill… Using, um… speed or intellect.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:42
How do we even pick?

[GM] 23:02:42
Um… You can choose whichever you wish.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:02:47
Like, we just click on Speed or Intellect?

[GM] 23:02:50
Uh, I mean, yes, if you don't have the zero G skill, then…

[Ink] 23:02:56
So, since Dex and I have 0G, we will use that one with the advantage from that. Can we help by helping them, can we give them advantage?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:03:06
I didn't know for the advantage, so I guess I'll just roll with it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:09
Oh, I clicked on 0G, even though I don't have it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:14
Oh, look at that roll.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:03:15
Yeah, it doesn't do anything.

[GM] 23:03:21
Um… Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:26
Hope 0 is not considered double zero, is it?

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:28
Alright, so you want me to roll something else, then?

[GM] 23:03:30
Uh…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:03:34
No, you're fine, you passed it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:36
Oh, I'm fine? Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:37
Like, two is… 2 is amazing. Yeah, you…

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:41
Good job, Inc!

[Ink] 23:03:42
Ah, you guys need to crush yours. I barely made it.

[GM] 23:03:48
Alright, so I just need to figure out if… Uh, Zeke's role is actually… This is actually a zero, meaning 100, or… What is this?

[GM] 23:04:00
I think it's… I think it's 00, uh, meaning… things go from… 0 to 99.

[GM] 23:04:08
Or is it 1 to 100?

[Dex Miro] 23:04:14
Why is it minus 1 anyways.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:24
I don't know what that's true means.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:33
I mean, well, it seems like they did that on purpose, so I don't think it wraps around, so they did mean to have zero in that.

[GM] 23:04:41
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:42
But if you have a regular D100, there's no… Is it a 0 or a 100?

[Dex Miro] 23:04:49
I don't know. I haven't really seen a D100 in person.

[GM] 23:04:50
Yeah, right?

[GM] 23:04:57
Um, typically, uh… the way that you, uh, represent it.

[GM] 23:05:04
And dice form. You usually have a percentile die.

[GM] 23:05:06
Which is essentially a D10, but it has… you know, essentially two digits on. They use another D10 to represent the… Um, one's place.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:13
Yeah.

[GM] 23:05:17
So you end up with triple zero is usually the… the score, or… Um… and that's usually represents 100.

[GM] 23:05:28
Here it says roll of 90 through 99 is a failure, and I can… safely say that that is not a 9 or a 99, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:36
I plan on that.

[GM] 23:05:37
So… Um, which would imply, then.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:37
Yeah.

[GM] 23:05:44
That, uh… this is actually… probably a critical success, even though I'm surprised it flagged it as red and not green.

[GM] 23:05:51
in doing so. Um…

[Ink] 23:06:01
I mean, Murderbot, you had a 2 and. This hero, those are crazy well.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:07
Yeah…

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:08
Makes you wonder what's gonna be rolled next.

[Ink] 23:06:09
Hopefully.

[GM] 23:06:13
Um, well, then Rico has to go. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:17
Oh, the fuck is Rico.

[Ink] 23:06:18
We get on the other side of the airlock, would you go…

[GM] 23:06:22
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:06:23
Does it give you, like, a whole stat sheet for Enrico?

[GM] 23:06:26
That's what I'm checking right now, see if I've got stats for her.

[Ink] 23:06:29
We've been watching her, she, good or bad in ZeroG?

[Dex Miro] 23:06:29
Yeah.

[GM] 23:06:32
She is not proficient like you and Dex are.

[GM] 23:06:40
Alright, Noriko.

[GM] 23:06:46
Oh… She's cheery and bright.

[GM] 23:06:50
She's earnestly friendly. Um…

[GM] 23:06:59
She is talking to you about the Minotaur. Uh, while she's floating down the hallway.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:06
Let's check that.

[GM] 23:07:10
First, I have to figure out…

[GM] 23:07:15
Um…

[GM] 23:07:21
Okay, I'm just gonna do this.

[GM] 23:07:26
Okay. Got it.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:26
Where's Murderbot in this one. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:07:27
Yeah, so I was trying to figure out who's missing there. I was like, there's only 5 people.

[Ink] 23:07:31
It seems to drop one person every time.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:35
No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:35
part of that.

[GM] 23:07:37
Okay. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:37
Where is Murderbot?

[Ink] 23:07:38
He's taking the picture.

[GM] 23:07:43
Despite her, sort of. blase approached this, she narrowly avoids all the webbing.

[Ink] 23:07:51
Okay.

[GM] 23:07:52
Uh, so yeah, you guys get through the hallway.

[GM] 23:07:55
No web's touched.

[Ink] 23:07:57
Interesting.

[GM] 23:08:10
Um, you get to an airlock? Uh, and that one is not locked, you open it up, and inside you see… Dimly lit by green and yellow grow lamps, uh, is.

[GM] 23:08:25
You're sort of… can tell even through the, um.

[GM] 23:08:31
Um… hazard suits… sort of filtration that the air is a bit musty.

[GM] 23:08:37
Um… And, uh, like, you immediately see, um… Uh, your, uh, visors and things begin to steam up a little bit.

[GM] 23:08:50
There are giant sealed glass cubes. Uh, inside are racks of algae.

[GM] 23:08:58
Um… this is effectively where oxygen is produced. It's an algae farm that produces oxygen for the station.

[Ink] 23:09:03
Oh, it's the algae farm.

[Ink] 23:09:09
No, Murderbot doesn't need oxygen, right? We would assume that most of the, uh… Robots in here might not, or the androids might not need.

[Ink] 23:09:17
Oxygen either, right? So that's how we can tell if you're a witch or not, we just put a bag over your head. If you die, you are human, and if you don't, you're angry.

[GM] 23:09:20
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:27
Oh, Jesus Christ!

[Ink] 23:09:29
Or drowned, yeah.

[GM] 23:09:30
Well, what if you… what if you think you're human?

[GM] 23:09:33
And your body operates like it's. You know, sort of mimics breathing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:37
Jeez.

[Ink] 23:09:37
Okay, so that's just stop breathing. And you lay there pretending to be dead until when?

[GM] 23:09:38
To make…

[GM] 23:09:44
Forever, because you're dead. Um, I will be right back.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:45
Until the sensors tell you there's nobody else in the room.

[Ink] 23:09:53
I will be right back, too.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:55
I will be right here!

[Dex Miro] 23:10:02
Starting to get a little concerned about Inc. Wanting to test to see if I'm an android or not.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:06
You? Well, I mean, there's a question about this?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:10
I mean, it's gonna happen at some point during this mission.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:12
Why?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:14
Because apparently Monarch makes you… I don't understand how it can turn people into androids, that didn't make any sense to me.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:18
Oh, oh, that, because of that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:24
Okay, but we've already questioning this?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:30
Well, that was the whole thing before, is, like, anybody coming off the station, they're suspicious of whether they're a human or an android, so… Does that mean they would just build an Android that looks like me and replace me all of a sudden, and then you guys might not notice?

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:41
Yeah. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:49
I scan you with my scanner.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:54
I don't know what it tells you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:56
We'll see.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:03
I mean, it's up to GM whether you have an Android that doesn't know he's an Android or not.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:06
Uh, this is true.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:15
GM, I scanned Dex with my scanner.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:24
How do we know these scanners work?

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:27
You don't know that either.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:28
It would seem like it'd be… if an AI can replace a human, an AI could replace a scanner.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:33
Shut up, just let me do this.

[GM] 23:14:38
Alright, it takes a little time. It was like 10 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:40
Stay still, Dex!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:43
You know what it's doing for 10 minutes? It's just… it's just doing nothing, and then…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:47
you know, the timer's ticking down, and after 10 minutes, it just goes, beep, human!

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:50
Stop talking, monarch!

[Ink] 23:14:53
Well, if we scan Murderbot. And it says human, then we know a thing's broken, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:57
That's true, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:57
Oh yeah, you can also scan me, and if it comes of Android, then, you know, you know it's working.

[GM] 23:15:05
Um, your scan decks. is not an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:10
Scare me, scare me!

[GM] 23:15:13
Spend another 10 minutes. Scanning.

[Ink] 23:15:13
Okay. Awesome.

[GM] 23:15:19
Uh, turns out that, uh, Murderbot is an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:23
This was a waste of time!

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:25
Why are we second-guessing each other?!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:25
Maybe it's just a random number generator, and we got lucky twice?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:28
Just flipping a coin.

[GM] 23:15:33
Um… While you…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:34
We need to get statistical significance.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:36
That is a… well, that is a perfectly appropriate thing for Zeke to say. It is just a good way to waste some time.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:42
Alright, let's go!

[GM] 23:15:43
Um… While you finish up scanning and packing where your scanner.

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:48
Oh, no.

[GM] 23:15:50
Um, you notice, uh… Um… Four, uh, people… floating through the atmosphere towards you.

[GM] 23:16:04
their, um… wearing all black, so you don't see them until they're pretty close.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:07
Oh, no.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:10
Oh, no.

[GM] 23:16:11
They have helmets with, uh, red visors. Um, they're… appear to be quite well armed.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:15
Oh, no.

[GM] 23:16:22
And, um… Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:30
Alright guys, what do we do?

[GM] 23:16:37
Uh, there… their armor reminds you of Commander Kilroy.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:40
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:46
Doesn't necessarily mean they're friendly.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:49
Who's Commander Kilroy again?

[Dex Miro] 23:16:52
Rachel, who briefed us at the start of the session.

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:54
Oh, so… their friendlies?

[Dex Miro] 23:16:57
Or the previous… sorry, the previous session.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:04
Okay…

[Dex Miro] 23:17:04
I mean, there might be… They're wearing the uniforms of people that.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:09
would be friendly, but we were basically told to not trust anyone on this station.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:14
Right?

[GM] 23:17:20
Uh, you were told that, yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:24
Can you make the scanner go fast so we can scan them?

[GM] 23:17:37
Um, upon them seeing you. They start doing hand signals to each other, and uh… They kind of spread out in the room.

[GM] 23:17:48
Um… Uh…

[Dex Miro] 23:17:48
Can we tell what the hand signals mean?

[Ink] 23:17:50
I mean, surround them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:52
And get ready to fight.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:54
It was one of them this.

[GM] 23:17:58
Uh… Karnak's able to tell you that the hand signals are.

[GM] 23:18:01
basically, like, take up defensive positions. Um… One of them calls out to you in sort of a rather robotic voice.

[GM] 23:18:12
It says… Identify yourselves.

[Ink] 23:18:20
Let's have, uh, our fellow robot. do the talking.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:29
I am… I… I…

[Dex Miro] 23:18:29
I don't think that's a good idea.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:31
I am… I am an android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:36
Identify yourselves.

[GM] 23:18:40
You identify as an android? It's okay. They opened fire.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:43
I don't think that's the way we should… I don't think that's the way we should have gone with this.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:43
that I…

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:46
What? Why do they open fire?

[Dex Miro] 23:18:47
I don't know why… Because they don't like androids.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:51
Wait, they're all androids, though!

[Dex Miro] 23:18:53
No, they're not.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:54
Wait, what? Hold on.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:57
I thought everybody on this thing was an android!

[GM] 23:19:01
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:19:01
Everybody on the station could potentially be an android, but… Ugh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:06
I'm sorry, hold on, I got my story wrong.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:08
This did not go well.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:09
I thought that humans aren't on the outside preventing the androids from getting out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:14
Right?

[Dex Miro] 23:19:15
We know there are a small number of humans on the station, but anyone that we meet could be an android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:19
Oh, we know that there are humans on the station? I thought the androids kill all the humans!

[Dex Miro] 23:19:24
I mean, like, they could have replaced any human with an android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:31
Okay, let me start this over, then.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:34
No, come on, I-I-I'm getting this wrong, hold on.

[GM] 23:19:34
No, no, no, they…

[Dex Miro] 23:19:34
I don't know, he's… if he didn't let you… He didn't let you back off about the crystals, he's not letting you back off with this.

[GM] 23:19:41
Yeah, hey guys, I'm an Android, and they're like, oh, kill it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:45
Oh, no. What did I do?

[GM] 23:19:48
Um, alright, how does combat even work again? Uh, is there an initiative, or do they just start… They just start shooting at you guys.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:53
Come on, hold on! No, let me go back on this one. I thought, I thought they were all androids.

[Ink] 23:19:54
Are we still… are we still good? We're still at 0G?

[GM] 23:19:59
You're still in zero G.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:00
I thought they were all the… we thought we were all androids, and they don't know that they're either alive or dead, or they think they're alive?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:09
Because they're androids, but they want to become real?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:12
Is this a story I was just making up in my head?

[Ink] 23:20:15
No, no, you're… you're not wrong, it's just not necessarily what we should have said.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:20
So they don't know their androids, they think they're human, therefore they want to kill androids?

[Ink] 23:20:24
And we don't know. This could be another… these could be other deep divers that are actually still human.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:29
I thought they were all dead!

[Ink] 23:20:31
we don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:32
Oh, motherfucker!

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:35
I thought they were all dead, that's why they sent this in.

[Ink] 23:20:41
You're not wrong Murderbot, we just don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:44
Okay, let me go back then. The black and whatever red, I thought that…

[GM] 23:20:45
Alright. No, that's true.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:49
The thing that they were wearing, I thought it was just these androids emulating what they… what… like, you know, other soldiers are wearing and stuff like that. I didn't think it was, like…

[Ink] 23:21:00
It might be, it might be, Murderbot, we don't know, but… It could be humans, either way. They think they're human, they're android, we don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:06
Okay, well, I fucked up then.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:09
Sounds like Murderbot gonna die. You guys are all hidden, right?

[GM] 23:21:10
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:21:10
The black and red is gonna… it's gonna look suspiciously like this did.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:13
Or no.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:20
Oh, okay. That's what they look like. Okay, now…

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:23
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:27
Alright, GM, what do we want to do?

[GM] 23:21:31
Uh, they take aim at each one of you, sort of, separately.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:35
No, just me! I am, not the rest of them!

[GM] 23:21:39
Well, they assume that all of you are androids, if at least one of you is an android, and one's self-identifying as an Android.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:21:45
But we have a scanner. Use our scanner.

[GM] 23:21:49
Um, okay. So, yeah, they… Let's see… Everyone but, uh… But ink that they're shooting at, uh, so… First one's on Dex…

[Ink] 23:21:54
There's four of them, GM?

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:54
Oh my god, did I just, like, party…

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:57
Party kill everybody?

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:04
He's dead.

[Ink] 23:22:05
Holy cow! Oh, man, Dex's dead.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:10
Dead.

[GM] 23:22:10
Uh… and then… Carnoc, and… Zeke, and… Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:11
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, guys.

[Ink] 23:22:11
Oh.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:12
1.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:17
Fuck me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:22:23
Do we want to low number or a high number?

[Dex Miro] 23:22:24
Wayward, do you feel like their attack rules, so…

[GM] 23:22:27
Mm-hmm. Uh, it's 3D time…

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:29
Damage?

[Dex Miro] 23:22:34
Oh, no. That's a lot of numbers.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:37
Yeah…

[GM] 23:22:37
Alright, this is Dex, your damage… Uh, Carnoc… Ear damage… I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:41
But what is the critical part, too?

[GM] 23:22:46
Uh, Zeke, this is your damage and Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 23:22:53
So how does this?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:22:54
Wait, what? I don't understand what the… what was the D100?

[GM] 23:22:56
That's their combat check.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:00
So they all passed, even though the numbers ranged from 8 to 100?

[GM] 23:23:03
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:04
I'm down to 3.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:04
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:07
Well, 100 is 0.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:08
Oh, okay, 100 to 0.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:11
Oh. So, what happens if I go below zero, GM?

[GM] 23:23:11
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:15
You're dead.

[GM] 23:23:16
You take a wound.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:18
And that's how we were checking that with Resolve.

[GM] 23:23:22
So with the wound, um… I don't have that one table here.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:34
So it was, like, the moment I get to zero, I take a wound, and then it just wraps around.

[GM] 23:23:38
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:39
Okay. To my max health again.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:41
like, you keep…

[GM] 23:23:45
Yes. Alright, uh, this is a gunshot wound, uh, Dex roll a D10.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:46
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:56
Okay, I actually don't have to change anything, because 14 is my max health.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:01
So… D10.

[GM] 23:24:06
6. Major injury. Um…

[GM] 23:24:16
Oh, 6. Gunshot wound to the neck. Oh, by the way, did you guys take, uh, reduce your damage based on, uh, your armor?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:18
Sounds very bad.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:18
Oh, no.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:24
No. Okay. Alright.

[GM] 23:24:25
Alright, you should probably do that. Um, but what it does mean is that your armor is destroyed if it… if the damage bypassed the total armor rating.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:25
No.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:24:27
How does he do that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:35
My armor is 1.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:36
Is that right?

[GM] 23:24:38
No, it is not right, because you should either be wearing a hazard suit or a vac suit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:41
Okay.

[GM] 23:24:43
Um… Your armor?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:44
Where does it even display that?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:24:47
So this isn't, like, our armor level on the sheet that we haven't used before. This is something else.

[GM] 23:24:53
No, this should be the armor level on your sheet.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:24:56
Oh, mine's 40.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:57
Mine's nothing.

[GM] 23:24:58
Well, that's definitely incorrect, because that's, like, the armor of a ship.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:03
What those… right.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:25:04
But there's an armor category, Sanity, Fear Body Armor.

[Ink] 23:25:07
I mean, Carnoc's built like a man, come on, look at him.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:25:10
And then there's…

[GM] 23:25:10
Well, Armor is… should be, uh… Okay, if you're wearing a hazard suit, your armor is 5.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:15
Oh, okay, cool.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:16
Right.

[GM] 23:25:17
If you're wearing a vac suit, your armor is 3.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:20
15 plus 5…

[Dex Miro] 23:25:20
Okay.

[GM] 23:25:21
I will be back in just a second.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:23
Let's talk

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:25
Sorry for getting us all killed, guys. I thought…

[Ink] 23:25:27
It's my fault I told you to talk.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:28
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:25:29
Alright. It's my fault to tell you to talk.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:25:30
Nobody died now with this anymore.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:33
Uh, my… in my head, I thought… I thought we were trying to be friendly with the androids in this…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:25:34
as our fleet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:40
on this, uh… on this, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:44
thing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:46
I thought I was trying to be, like, a representative.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:50
And talk them down from doing anything to the rest of us humans, but…

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:55
My bad!

[Dex Miro] 23:25:57
Okay. I guess then… I don't know what it means to my headaches gets destroyed, I'll have to ask GM.

[Ink] 23:26:09
Let me go get you another one from that one room.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:12
There's… we'll probably find one somewhere, but something we don't know that right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:16
I think we're all gonna die.

[Ink] 23:26:17
Did you say that we spread out, or they still grouped together?

[GM] 23:26:20
There are spread out. Um… Let's see…

[Dex Miro] 23:26:23
So, so what happens if my hazard 2 gets destroyed, it's just completely useless now?

[GM] 23:26:27
It's completely useless. there's essentially a giant hole.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:29
Yeah. Okay, but that seems better than taking a gun.

[GM] 23:26:33
A giant hole in your hazard suit.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:34
Yeah, but I'd rather have that instead of a gunshot wound to the neck, so that seems… Do I just delete it?

[GM] 23:26:41
Uh, yeah, you might as well. It's not… not repairable.

[Dex Miro] 23:26:42
Okay.

[GM] 23:26:46
Preferable. terrible. Um, I don't know what the critical…

[GM] 23:26:56
Let me see if I can find this.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:26:58
For their arms at zero, effectively.

[GM] 23:27:02
Yeah. Hmm.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:05
Is that what it does? Did you look it up?

[GM] 23:27:20
Okay, let me try this…

[GM] 23:27:25
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 23:27:55
Yeah. Characters ignore all damage less than their armor points.

[GM] 23:28:00
If they ever take damage greater than or AP one hit, the armor is destroyed and they suffer any remaining damage.

[GM] 23:28:10
Um…

[Ink] 23:28:24
Why are we scanning people to see if they're human?

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:30
When?

[Ink] 23:28:30
Why did we start scanning people, or each other?

[Dex Miro] 23:28:32
Oh my gosh. I think he was just feeling paranoid.

[Ink] 23:28:36
Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:40
Is that what set it off?

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:43
And these people showed up?

[Dex Miro] 23:28:45
I mean, it might just be that we were standing somewhere where a camera could see us and wasting time.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:53
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:28:57
Okay, a roll of 0-0 is always a critical success. Okay.

[GM] 23:29:02
I don't know why. Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:29:06
But what is the critical success mean on a combat role?

[GM] 23:29:10
something… something good happens for him. Um… he knows his wife has been faithful.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:18
Okay, so it doesn't stop my hour from working.

[GM] 23:29:21
No. No. Um… Okay. Uh, your guys' turn.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:23
Okay. So… did I still get shot in the neck? It just… my hazards would help protect me?

[GM] 23:29:32
Right.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:34
Wait, why did you get shot in the neck?

[Dex Miro] 23:29:37
Because that's where the guy shot me. And when I did the wound roll that I didn't actually end up taking, that's what happened.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:38
I thought…

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:38
They all shot at us.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:43
Well, why did…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:45
Why did you take a wound roll? That's why.

[Dex Miro] 23:29:47
Because my health would have gone to zero. But with the armor, it wouldn't have.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:50
Oh, mine would have gone to zero, too.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:54
So mine would have gone to zero, too, without the armor.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:03
So, do I need a wound roll? I'm confused.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:04
I mean, if it doesn't go to zero, then I don't think we need the moon roll, right?

[GM] 23:30:08
Great.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:09
Yeah, but… But then you just have to mark your arm is destroyed.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:09
Oh, okay, so you didn't get it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:13
Yeah, okay. That's what I thought. I… something is so confused me, sorry.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:18
Like, right, the fact that I've got a shot of the neck instead of just being shot is now just flavor text.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:30:22
Okay, I got it.

[GM] 23:30:29
Really? That's crazy.

[Ink] 23:30:38
I kind of like how that picture turned out.

[Ink] 23:30:43
epic.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:54
Anybody?

[Ink] 23:30:57
We really stand a chance of fighting these guys?

[Dex Miro] 23:31:00
No?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:31:02
Not after they struck first.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:09
What are we… can we say something like, we were sent by… what's, uh…

[Ink] 23:31:09
And they're…

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:13
Kilroy?

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:16
Stop shooting?

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:18
I don't know, that might be… just be like, alright, these guys need to be put down.

[Ink] 23:31:22
I like that. I mean, they can see that we're armed, right, GM?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:31:24
We should try that.

[GM] 23:31:25
They can see you're armed.

[Ink] 23:31:27
Okay, so we're gonna put up our hands and say.

[Ink] 23:31:30
We weren't gonna fight you, we were sent by, uh, we were sent by Kilroy, I guess? I like that idea.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:33
Stop shooting, motherfuckers!

[Ink] 23:31:36
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:37
We're here to help!

[Ink] 23:31:42
This room is lit, but they probably have night vision on their suits, right?

[GM] 23:31:48
Seems probable. Um…

[GM] 23:31:56
Hmm…

[GM] 23:32:03
Hmm…

[GM] 23:32:12
Okay, that's what… that's what, uh…

[GM] 23:32:18
ink and, uh… Murderbot do.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:32:26
Yeah, I'll raise my hands, too.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:31
What does Noriko do?

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:34
She's dead, probably.

[GM] 23:32:34
Um… No, no, she didn't get shot. I forgot to include her in the role.

[Ink] 23:32:36
How did she start?

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:41
What the fuck?!

[GM] 23:32:42
Uh… Well…

[Dex Miro] 23:32:43
Excellent. Well, she probably just started talking about the Minotaur, and they also thought she was crazy and didn't bother shooting her.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:44
I'm gonna fucking shave my head.

[Ink] 23:32:46
Trained in the meantime.

[GM] 23:32:53
Okay…

[GM] 23:32:59
Um… I guess they're willing to… okay, they tell you to surrender your weapons.

[GM] 23:33:04
like, push them over towards them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:16
Okay.

[Ink] 23:33:17
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:18
I guess so. Hold up my pulse rifle and…

[Ink] 23:33:23
Yeah, push.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:25
The Zeke dropped to the ground.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:27
Like, I'm at 1, I'm just, like, playing dead. I'm just, like, splayed out on the ground.

[GM] 23:33:27
You can't…

[Dex Miro] 23:33:30
Then… then you just float in the air, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:32
Oh, it's 0G, so I'm like, ugh, floating…

[GM] 23:33:32
Yeah. Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:36
Yeah.

[GM] 23:33:37
It's a picture. Zeke gave himself a little momentum, too, so he's, like, kind of, like, spinning through the air, just… Um… Unless you have a wound, there's no blood shooting out of you, uh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:33:43
Right, you know, just like…

[Dex Miro] 23:33:51
Okay.

[GM] 23:33:52
But… Um, so everyone… throws, you know, disarms and sends their weapons over to the… To the, uh, troubleshooters.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:34:07
Your symptoms.

[Ink] 23:34:08
I'm gonna send, yeah, I'm gonna send my SMG over to them.

[GM] 23:34:11
Okay. Alright, to do some hand signals, uh, which… Uh, Carnoc's able to determine means that they're going to, you know, essentially two of them.

[GM] 23:34:22
are going to hold position with. There are weapons trained on you guys to make sure there's no funny business. The other two are gonna approach.

[GM] 23:34:31
Um… The two that approach… uh, have their weapons trained on you guys.

[GM] 23:34:40
And one… pulls out, um… essentially what our futuristic zip ties.

[GM] 23:34:52
And, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:56
Guys, this is unnecessary.

[GM] 23:34:59
Oh, it's definitely necessary. Um… to throw, uh, the zip ties… And they told him to put them on each other, uh, on each of you guys, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:01
Why?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:07
Well, who the fuck are you? Identify yourselves!

[GM] 23:35:12
Uh, we're troubleshooters.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:15
That's what the f- that's what we are!

[GM] 23:35:17
Uh, you're not troubleshooters. No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:18
Oh, we're not?

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:23
Troubleshooters of what?

[GM] 23:35:26
of androids.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:28
What? What does that mean?

[GM] 23:35:31
Um…

[GM] 23:35:36
Hmm…

[GM] 23:35:48
Um… The, uh, one floats up to Murderbot and puts his… pulse rifle against his head, and says, you don't want to find out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:55
Ugh, wholly unnecessary, bro. Come on now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:01
Why? What for? We're all cooperating here. There's no need for this.

[GM] 23:36:07
Are you guys cooperating? Are you putting the, uh, zip ties on each other?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:09
Well, I would like to know where we're going!

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:12
Where are you taking us?

[GM] 23:36:13
Oh. We'll find out.

[Ink] 23:36:14
Well, what is it, sir? Put the zip tie button.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:15
We'll find out! Stop being vague, just tell us what we're doing here, man.

[GM] 23:36:23
Um… Are you putting those zip ties on? If you're not putting the zip ties on, that feeling gets a lot worse.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:23
I'm about to die.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:30
Hi. Alright, I'll put my zip ties on myself.

[Ink] 23:36:31
Yeah, putting it as a…

[Dex Miro] 23:36:35
Oh, so they were having us put the zip ties on each other.

[GM] 23:36:36
Um… Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:39
I don't know.

[GM] 23:36:41
Uh, and then after everyone's zip-tied, except for… whoever the last person that's zip-tied any other people.

[GM] 23:36:48
Uh, one of the troubleshooters, zip ties that guy.

[GM] 23:36:51
Or, I guess it could… Well, she's getting zip-tied.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:52
What does Noriko do?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:56
Oh, but she's okay with it?

[GM] 23:36:57
Well, I rolled to see if she went berserk, or if she complied, and so she… I rolled comply.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:02
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:04
Interesting.

[GM] 23:37:07
When you guys held up your hands, I was like, uh, she might just start shooting, who knows?

[Ink] 23:37:12
You got a gun? We give her a gun.

[GM] 23:37:14
Of course, she's got a gun, she's got two SMGs, she's got one in each hand.

[GM] 23:37:21
Um, but she threw those away. Uh, alright.

[GM] 23:37:28
Um… Yeah. The… you guys get zip-tied, um… The… one of them tells… the other one to collect the weapons.

[GM] 23:37:43
Um, keep them together, they might need the ammunition.

[GM] 23:37:47
Um…

[GM] 23:37:52
Okay.

[Ink] 23:37:54
Can I help? Can we help Zeke? He killed him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:58
Yeah, we need medical attention here.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:01
Oh, does he? I don't know if he does.

[Ink] 23:38:03
Well, I don't think he does, but we don't know that. He looks dead to us, right?

[GM] 23:38:07
He's dead. Um… I mean, he doesn't have any weapons, so they're not really worried about him being dead.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:09
What?

[Ink] 23:38:13
So he's just floating there dead. He's dead.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:15
But he's not… he's not dead. Oh, I see.

[GM] 23:38:15
Yeah. He's dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:38:22
Bank off.

[GM] 23:38:27
role for body save to hold your coffin. Um… Alright, uh, yeah, they don't seem to care about Zeke's body floating around and bumping off of… bouncing off of things.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:37
Jesus Christ.

[GM] 23:38:41
Um… Okay.

[GM] 23:38:46
They say they're going to take you guys back to their ship.

[Ink] 23:38:50
They have a ship? I thought we didn't see any ships.

[GM] 23:38:53
Uh-huh. Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:38:57
They're heading their ship than we were.

[Ink] 23:39:01
That's interesting.

[GM] 23:39:03
Um… So… they essentially, um… loop all of your arms?

[GM] 23:39:15
through, like, a metal wire cable. So, like, they, like, kind of, like, snake it through, so you guys are all kind of attached to each other, and they just kind of pull you.

[GM] 23:39:26
Um… I'm dragging you through the zero tree.

[GM] 23:39:31
Um… They also do something similar with your weapons.

[GM] 23:39:38
Um, so the weapons are… Uh, kind of tied together.

[GM] 23:39:44
Um… And they're pulled along as well.

[GM] 23:39:50
Um… to take you into the next room… And, let's see, 5090…

[GM] 23:40:01
90… Uh, in this room, there's a bunch of… dials and readouts of pressure and atmospheric.

[GM] 23:40:13
Monitoring… everything seems to be pretty good.

[GM] 23:40:17
Um, there's a yellow alert. sort of flashing.

[GM] 23:40:22
Um…

[GM] 23:40:27
as they sort of pull you by one of the councils, uh, you catch a glimpse of the alert.

[GM] 23:40:33
Uh, it seems to imply that some of the, uh… atmospheric containers were… damaged?

[GM] 23:40:41
Um… Yeah.

[Ink] 23:40:42
During our fight?

[GM] 23:40:47
Um… but it doesn't look critical in any way.

[GM] 23:40:51
Um, you also see atmospheric control for all the floors.

[GM] 23:40:55
Um, however, um… Floor 5 does not appear to have atmosphere.

[GM] 23:41:05
Um… Then they take you out the north… I assume this is an airlock.

[GM] 23:41:14
Um, by the way, the lights are on in this area.

[GM] 23:41:22
Um, to kind of blink as they pull you through here.

[GM] 23:41:27
Um… 59B.

[GM] 23:41:34
Um, you see blood-stained half-meter spikes covering the tunnel walls.

[GM] 23:41:40
Um… And there's graffiti on the floor that says, you can't take it with you.

[GM] 23:41:48
Um…

[GM] 23:41:57
the… one of them, um… turns to you all and says, do you have an artifact on you?

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:10
What are you talking about?

[GM] 23:42:17
Do you have an artifact on you?

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:19
No, we don't even know what our artifact is!

[GM] 23:42:23
Alright, you'll regret it if you do.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:24
What?!

[Dex Miro] 23:42:25
You might. I don't know if you do or not.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:33
What does it look like?

[GM] 23:42:36
Uh, they look like all different kinds of things.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:41
Okay?

[Ink] 23:42:42
Right, but you might want to give up your purple crystals.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:43
For example,

[GM] 23:42:48
Um…

[Ink] 23:42:49
Can you wiggle the purple crystals out of your pocket, even if your hands are tight?

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:51
I can, my hands are fucking tied!

[GM] 23:42:55
You could probably get them out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:58
We found these!

[GM] 23:43:01
You pull out a purple crystal.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:03
Yep. Is this an artifact?

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:05
Assholes?

[GM] 23:43:06
Yeah. Uh, make it body safe.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:09
Ah, the fuck.

[GM] 23:43:13
Was your armor destroyed?

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:16
Uh, yeah, well, I don't… yeah, I had, like, 5 armor, and I had to use the 5 to give me… to 8 instead of 3.

[GM] 23:43:24
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:43:25
Sorry, my favorite part about this picture is Noriko's still grinning like a fool.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:26
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:31
Oh, what safe? What was it again?

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:33
Body safe?

[GM] 23:43:33
A body save.

[GM] 23:43:43
Okay. You pull the crystal out of your pocket.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:46
Oh, fuck me.

[GM] 23:43:47
Um, and… the kind of stop and look, and they're like, yeah, that looks like one, and… it kind of slips out of your fingers and kind of, like, floats up towards your head.

[GM] 23:43:59
Um, and then… Uh, it, like…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:59
Oh, fuck me.

[GM] 23:44:06
Hmm… It hits you in the chin, and you feel this weird sensation as it fuses with your skin.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:17
Carnoc, I think it's time to say the word.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:26
Kill me!

[GM] 23:44:29
It's, it's not…

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:30
Put me out of my misery!

[GM] 23:44:36
It's not that big, it looks like you have, like, a.

[GM] 23:44:38
purple M&M stuck to your chin. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:41
Simple?

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:43
a big-ass pit bull.

[GM] 23:44:46
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:47
Get it off, make sure that I don't want to live like this, I'm hideous!

[GM] 23:44:55
Uh, the, uh, the troubleshooters turn, they're like, yeah, that looks like a fucking artifact.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:00
Well, you could have described it better, fuck you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:03
This is on you. You see this pimple? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:07
I'm gonna… what's your name? I'm gonna call it Troubleshooter1, named after you, asshole.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:13
I'm gonna die anyway, I don't know what this is, seems like a disease, but…

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:17
I'm gonna take you fuckers with me.

[GM] 23:45:17
Um… The, uh… um… troubleshooter's like, well, now… If it's… if the artifact stuck to his skin, can he even get through there?

[GM] 23:45:32
I don't know. I mean… Do we care what the happens to them?

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:33
Yeah, go ahead, try, let's do it. I don't care, I don't give a fuck.

[GM] 23:45:39
Just make sure he goes by himself.

[Ink] 23:45:45
Which room do you know?

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:46
Say it!

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:48
Save yourselves!

[Ink] 23:45:50
GM, which room are we in? Sorry.

[GM] 23:45:52
You're in 59B, 4-way intersection. Um…

[Ink] 23:45:55
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:56
troubleshoot this!

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:03
How about this? I take the rest of the…

[GM] 23:46:03
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:05
the crystals out, and I throw them at the troubleshooters.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:11
Wood.

[GM] 23:46:15
Uh, alright, that's fine.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:17
Why? Why? Why do you do these things?

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:20
Well, I mean, they're not telling us anything!

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:24
And it seems like I'm doomed, might as well take these guys out, they're the biggest threat to you guys, so…

[GM] 23:46:31
Alright, make a… make a speed check.

[Ink] 23:46:36
You should have done it when they were floating through the, uh… corridor.

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:38
I didn't know it was attached to my face, Ink.

[Ink] 23:46:41
No, no, you should have waited until they were halfway through the quarter, and then chucked the purple crystals at them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:47
Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:48
Okay, well…

[Murderbot V2] 23:46:51
I'm just waiting for Carnoc to put me out of my misery right now.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:46:55
We're chained up right next to you, aren't we?

[GM] 23:46:57
Yeah, definitely explodes. The entire party's getting caught in an explosion.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:02
Do it!

[GM] 23:47:06
All right, uh… Murderbot… He whips… he whips a bunch of crystals down the hallway towards, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:08
I'm not fast enough, anyway.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:10
It does seem like.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:14
You mean THESE ARTIFACTS??!

[GM] 23:47:22
In his uncontrolled spray, he also whips it towards all of the party members, too.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:23
No, no sale!

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:27
Oh, fuck.

[Ink] 23:47:28
Uh…

[GM] 23:47:31
Um, we'll… You are also probably gonna hit Noriko, um… The, uh, crystals go floating in slow motion. It's like, you know, they're spinning through the air and stuff, but, like… The, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:31
As long as I don't hit Noriko.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:37
Oh, Noriko!

[GM] 23:47:48
troubleshooters aren't in a position to react wildly to these things.

[GM] 23:47:53
Uh, and so, you see the crystals.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:54
It's okay, nobody else is an android. They probably just attach to Androids.

[GM] 23:47:58
Yeah, the crystals go floating through there, and they… hit the troubleshooters in the, like, all over, and… Uh, the crystals fuse to their skin.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:05
Do they attach to them?

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:08
Oh, they're androids!

[GM] 23:48:10
Meanwhile, the crystals just bounce harmlessly off the rest of the party.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:14
Yeah, I did it for you guys!

[GM] 23:48:17
uh, suddenly… Uh, Murderbot's consciousness is merged with all the other, uh… troubleshooters.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:18
Oh, fuck.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:24
Oh, shit.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:27
What?

[GM] 23:48:28
Um… Hmm… make a sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:30
Zim

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:39
Oh, fuck.

[GM] 23:48:42
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:44
This is Murderbot signing off.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:49
I am now the entity!

[GM] 23:48:49
Yeah, but… Murderbot shuts down, uh, and… the troubleshooters yell out.

[GM] 23:48:58
Let's try and control our minds. Um… And, uh, they start… Sort of… was I gonna panic? They might panic.

[Ink] 23:49:15
Uh, GM, can I… can I activate an Espernetic Feedback Loop?

[Ink] 23:49:19
Um, feedback loop? It's a psionic attack that overloads a targeted electronic systems, including androids, make sanity save, it's successful, deal damage equal to the amount rolled on failure to take one DMG.

[GM] 23:49:20
Okay, what's that do?

[Ink] 23:49:31
And gain one stress test, per usual.

[GM] 23:49:34
Okay. They fail their sanity checks.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:43
Am I no longer in control of myself?

[GM] 23:49:45
You're shut down. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:49:45
You're shut down.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:46
Oh, I am shut down completely.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:50
Fuck.

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:54
Can somebody reboot me?

[Dex Miro] 23:49:58
Was that all the soldiers, or only two soldiers start to go crazy?

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:01
All of them.

[GM] 23:50:03
I don't know, Ink, are there limits to the number that can be affected?

[Ink] 23:50:08
I just want to have for you, cyanic attack, um, that overloads a targeted electronics, including Androids.

[Ink] 23:50:14
It doesn't… doesn't come here. Yeah, including Androids and cybernetics, make a sanity save.

[GM] 23:50:15
It says multiple there, so I assume… you know.

[Ink] 23:50:21
If sex will deal damage to the equal amount rolled.

[Ink] 23:50:24
So do I make a sanity save? Yeah, that makes sense, right, so… So I'm clicking Sanity, no advantage, normal.

[GM] 23:50:25
Oh, maybe you make a sanity safe.

[Ink] 23:50:33
No modifier. I failed and take one DMG. What's a DMG?

[GM] 23:50:33
I assume so? Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:42
Damage.

[Ink] 23:50:43
Yeah. My health goes down, and I also take one stress.

[GM] 23:50:43
One just, yeah, one damage.

[GM] 23:50:49
Um, also, yeah, for anybody who failed. saves or checks so far this… make sure you count that as stress.

[GM] 23:50:57
Um…

[GM] 23:51:02
You like… Uh, in kind of, like, narrows his eyes and looks at the troubleshooters, and then.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:51:03
check.

[GM] 23:51:09
He, like, focuses his brain. And he, like, kind of grunts.

[GM] 23:51:14
And then let's a little fart.

[GM] 23:51:19
Um… they're like, what the wrong with that guy?

[GM] 23:51:24
Um… They're like, alright, well, now how the are we getting through this?

[GM] 23:51:30
this place. Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:51:36
So the soldiers didn't go crazy then?

[GM] 23:51:38
No. They did yell a lot. They yelled a lot, like, he's fucking trying to take over our minds, and then, like… Murderbot shut down, and they seemed to, like…

[Dex Miro] 23:51:42
Okay.

[Ink] 23:51:49
so that I failed my attack then?

[GM] 23:51:52
I assume so?

[Ink] 23:51:54
It's only tech that overloads the target electronics. Like I said, if successful deal, damage equal to the amount rolled. So I failed, so I don't deal any damage.

[GM] 23:52:01
Yeah, that's what my guess is.

[Ink] 23:52:03
Gotcha. Can I try again?

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:06
How many times can you do it? That's a question.

[Ink] 23:52:08
I would assume I can just keep taking stress and damage.

[Ink] 23:52:10
Right?

[GM] 23:52:11
Probably? Um… But, uh… before, uh… Before you are able to attack again.

[GM] 23:52:27
Let's see… I have to check something real quick.

[GM] 23:52:44
The airlock to the east opens, and you see, uh… horrifying creature, as featured on.

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:50
Oh, shit.

[GM] 23:52:51
On this page, come scrambling through. Um… And that's where we're going to stop.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:03
What the fuck is that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:05
Is that the thing that made the webs?

[Dex Miro] 23:53:05
We, uh… hopefully that's…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:53:08
It's hard to… yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:53:10
Good guess.

[Dex Miro] 23:53:11
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:53:12
Make no…

[GM] 23:53:13
It doesn't indeed look like a spider.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:13
I'm sorry, guys.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:18
Break free, throw me toward it, and say the words.

[GM] 23:53:24
Man, I was really hoping you were gonna make that sanity save, though, Murderbot, because I was gonna give you control of all of them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:28
That would have been awesome.

[Ink] 23:53:30
Oh…

[GM] 23:53:31
That would have been cool.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:32
Uh, does anyone have any inspiration left?

[Ink] 23:53:36
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:38
I could use some of that right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:40
Fuck, I'm sorry, guys.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:44
I honestly thought I was doing the right thing, because I was sitting there going, I'm like, oh, okay, well, I'll…

[GM] 23:53:45
You just yelled, I'm an android. You could have… you could have said so many other things.

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:50
On behalf of the androids, they will take me in, because I'm… I'm an android, but then…

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:55
I guess I didn't… I wasn't paying attention to, like, what… what we were facing. I just assumed the whole place was androids.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:04
the teams that were sent in were dead.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:06
But these guys are androids too, so…

[Ink] 23:54:10
They just don't know it.

[GM] 23:54:10
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:12
Oh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:17
Gotcha. And so they're… they… they are Andrews. This whole place is Androids that don't know they're androids, that want to kill androids.

[Ink] 23:54:18
That's what they're trying to… you weren't wrong, because…

[GM] 23:54:27
Well, the troubleshooters want to kill androids.

[Ink] 23:54:28
We.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:32
But the troubleshooters have to know their bosses are androids, no?

[GM] 23:54:38
But their bosses aren't androids, their bosses, Commander Kilroy, or whatever last name is.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:42
Oh, so these are…

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:45
people that they sent in.

[Dex Miro] 23:54:48
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:49
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:52
Kilroy sent in androids, and they're still alive.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:56
No?

[Ink] 23:54:58
We… probably what happened is she sent in real humans, they were replaced by androids who don't realize that they're.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:03
Oh, this is getting fucking confusing, man!

[Ink] 23:55:07
You weren't wrong with what you were thinking before, just you're missing the.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:07
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:10
Right, right, the twist.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:12
Gotcha.

[Ink] 23:55:12
Yeah.

[GM] 23:55:15
I'm an android.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:17
I know. Well, that didn't work.

[Ink] 23:55:19
They are all too, they just don't know it.

[GM] 23:55:21
Yeah, I know, but it's the wrong thing to say to a troubleshooter.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:22
I should be like, just like you assholes! And they're like, we're not androids.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:27
It's like, the fuck you aren't!

[GM] 23:55:28
Why do you have… why do you have purple M&Ms stuck to your skin, then?

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:31
Yeah, you've got fucking…

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:34
Android Acne, just like I do, motherfucker.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:38
Look at your face, assholes!

[GM] 23:55:39
Well, I guess it was a… as soon as it hit your chin, you were like, oh, my life's over.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:43
I was like, I'm so ugly! Do me now, Carnoc! Do me now!

[Ink] 23:55:57
Does this creature look mechanical or biological?

[GM] 23:56:01
Uh, both.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:03
Goddamn.

[Ink] 23:56:03
Okay.

[GM] 23:56:05
Mostly biological, but… Uh, it's… you know, body looks like there are parts of it made of metal.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:18
Holy crap, that's even more terrifying than the thing GM sent.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:21
Jesus!

[Ink] 23:58:25
I don't know how Quake got all of that from it, it's not that.

[GM] 23:58:31
It should have… oh, it's okay, it's pretty close.

[GM] 23:58:35
I was gonna say, it should have slightly human appendages in other… in certain places.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:38
Oh my god!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:46
That's cool.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:55
Well, good luck, guys. Hey.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:57
If you really need to use my, uh, body as a decoy, so you guys can run away.

[Ink] 23:59:03
Yeah, so Zeke floating space Murderbot shut down.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:06
Yeah. Zeke's about to come from behind and use all the weapons.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:59:11
I am about to come around and use all the weapons, but I can't hit anything with them, so…

[Ink] 23:59:11
Yeah, did you… Did they leave… I thought they were towing the weapons with us.

[GM] 23:59:17
Yeah, the Zeke's without a weapon floating and bouncing off things in the other room, but…

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:20
Oh, BTW, we are all wired together, too, so…

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:25
Enjoy that.

[Ink] 23:59:28
taking control of them. Oh, that would have been amazing.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:30
Like a gift wrap snack for whatever this thing is.

[Ink] 23:59:36
Yeah. Hopefully it likes Androids more than a… Humans.

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:43
I think, yeah, these are trackers to… so that it can go hunt…

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:49
Android's done, and it seems like it's taking Android limbs and putting it on itself, or…

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:54
merging itself with…

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:57
other androids, that's just my initial unconscious guess.

[GM] 00:00:06
Um… the real upsetting thing will be when you find out how much the purple crystals were worth.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:13
Oh my fucking god, don't you fucking dare.

[GM] 00:00:18
Just threw him down the hallway, just like…

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:20
Oh, I thought they were bombs or something, man. I just wanted to, like, get a distraction so we could run away or something. These guys…

[GM] 00:00:27
It definitely worked. Definitely worked. They're all bouncing off the walls and stuff.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:28
I mean, don't we still have some of them?

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:33
These guys, uh…

[Ink] 00:00:34
go together and back up.

[GM] 00:00:35
This guy with his hands.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:36
I mean, these guys had to drop on us, they're more tactical, they're better at weapons, are they… probably the only person that probably could take a moment was Carnoc, and he's just won.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:48
So… I had to do something.

[Ink] 00:00:52
The only thing I can think of, yeah, is when they're… if they went first down the quarter, if you threw one or two crystals at them, and it… stuck or triggered the things it was smashed in.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:02
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:03
Or it would only target them.

[Ink] 00:01:06
Yeah, exactly.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:07
Yeah.

[GM] 00:01:15
The, yeah, the crystals are still bouncing around the room, so it's not like they're destroyed or anything.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:21
Yeah, so…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:24
Take up…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:25
I mean, I'm guessing this thing's gonna take out the… the…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:29
the troubleshooters, and then you take this thing out, and then…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:32
Go grab the rest of the crystals, grab me, and get the fuck out of there, let's go.

[GM] 00:01:38
Let's go!

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:40
Mickey Mouse ears.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:49
Um, next time…
