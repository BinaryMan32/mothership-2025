[Dex] 21:31:53
Is it, like, obnoxiously large and hard to carry around?

[GM] 21:32:00
Or it's anti-armor is what it says. Yes, it has to be fired from a prone or braced position, so you can't just, like…

[GM] 21:32:00
Pull it over your shoulder and expect to shoot it. You have to actually, like… it has, like, um…

[GM] 21:32:07
Not a tripod, but, like, the little legs that you have to set on the ground, or set on a solid surface to be able to, like, even begin to align the shot.

[GM] 21:32:16
So… 2D10 times.

[Carnoc] 21:32:17
Would you say the damage was, sir?

[GM] 21:32:21
So, somewhere between… 10 and… 100 damage.

[Dex] 21:32:32
Well.

[GM] 21:32:33
It's also heavy.

[GM] 21:32:38
Uh, it's two-handed. And if you try to use it in combat.

[GM] 21:32:45
At close range, you have disadvantage.

[Carnoc] 21:32:57
Was there a critical effect?

[GM] 21:33:00
Um… no.

[Carnoc] 21:33:05
And how many shots in the magazine?

[GM] 21:33:07
5.

[Carnoc] 21:33:13
What'd you say AMR stood for again? Anto material.

[GM] 21:33:17
Anti-material rifle.

[Ink] 21:33:22
That, like, antimatter?

[GM] 21:33:26
This is anti-material, so… I don't know.

[Carnoc] 21:33:30
It destroys material.

[Ink] 21:33:33
Okay.

[GM] 21:33:42
Um, okay.

[GM] 21:33:49
I think that. It's basically, like, the only kind of…

[GM] 21:33:54
Loot, maybe in the whole module, so I want to make sure you guys… There was a scrotum backpack that fell into a crevasse, but…

[Ink] 21:34:02
That's right. Do we have time to go get the bio bed, or was that destroyed?

[Murderbot] 21:34:04
Rotam backpack.

[GM] 21:34:09
Um, the vial bed was destroyed. I mean, you can recover some of the parts, but… you won't be able to assemble a whole one from… Right, right.

[Ink] 21:34:14
Because the place… the place burned down. Okay.

[Ink] 21:34:20
And it was already damaged anyway.

[GM] 21:34:22
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:34:25
Alright, so I think we've learned our lesson. Let's not shoot and explode things, right?

[Dex] 21:34:33
But we don't think the cargo transmission got recorded. In a way where anybody could get infected later.

[GM] 21:34:38
Well. Um… No, you suspect that if Hinton's Logic Core contains that all of.

[GM] 21:34:49
Like, what he knew. And he knew about the transmissions, he knew how to speak CARC.

[GM] 21:34:56
That likely his logic core… is, um, probably contains that information.

[Dex] 21:35:04
Right. So we need to be careful about who we give that to.

[GM] 21:35:10
Um, I mean, the expectation is…

[Dex] 21:35:12
Did Moss already snatch it?

[GM] 21:35:16
I mean, he didn't… physically take it from you guys, uh, that being said, it's, you know.

[GM] 21:35:23
He… he definitely isn't… expecting you all to deliver that.

[GM] 21:35:28
Slash, you know, that's… you know, at some point that'll be handed over to other people in the company.

[GM] 21:35:35
That was your whole mission, effectively, was to recover that, and Dr. Adam.

[Dex] 21:35:41
Oh, okay. So, no bonus, because it was the requirement.

[GM] 21:35:56
Um… So, um, Moss tells you that with this many people.

[GM] 21:36:04
On this small ship that… nearly everybody's gonna have to go into cryo sleep, uh, for the month travel back to the.

[GM] 21:36:13
Complete because… there's not enough life support to sustain this many people.

[GM] 21:36:21
So… He's like, I'll… I'll stay awake, we don't have our Android anymore to be able to…

[GM] 21:36:30
Fly the ship without it. It's for me to sleep, but…

[Ink] 21:36:37
Yeah, just plug Kinn's logic board. He's dead.

[Carnoc] 21:36:38
Does… does Murder Brat want to stay awake? Oh, yeah, right.

[Murderbot] 21:36:41
Murderbot's gone!

[GM] 21:36:41
He's gone.

[Murderbot] 21:36:48
My consciousness has been uploaded to the mainframe, and now will be downloaded into another synth body.

[Ink] 21:36:54
With no memory.

[Dex] 21:36:55
I mean, you might have a recent backup, but… Do you have to pay for that, too?

[Murderbot] 21:37:03
I ain't paying for shit!

[Ink] 21:37:04
Yeah, the company owns it.

[Dex] 21:37:05
Oh, I'm sure you are.

[Dex] 21:37:12
I'm pretty sure if you didn't purchase. Since Brain Backup Insurance, then you'll never be coming back.

[Murderbot] 21:37:18
I am not an entity, sir. I am just an extension of the company.

[Zeke] 21:37:24
I purchased the… Medical insurance plan…

[Zeke] 21:37:30
Company paid before I leave that says… Like, if I get injured on company dime, they cover the cost of my medical bills.

[GM] 21:37:32
Yeah, you have company insurance.

[Murderbot] 21:37:32
What's your deductible? $1 million?

[Dex] 21:37:39
Is it deducted from our wages?

[Ink] 21:37:41
Yeah.

[GM] 21:37:41
Yeah, do you guys have company insurance?

[Murderbot] 21:37:42
Is it United Healthcare? They just denied… they just denied your…

[Dex] 21:37:45
Ugh

[Ink] 21:37:47
Yeah. You're gonna need another referral, huh?

[Murderbot] 21:37:48
Claim.

[GM] 21:37:56
Um… So, he puts you all into cryo sleep before putting himself into cryo sleep.

[GM] 21:38:04
Uh, he… And basically, with almost no time passing.

[GM] 21:38:10
Um, your next memory is sort of, uh. Awakening at the, uh…

[GM] 21:38:17
I mean, you're waking out on the ship, um, everyone needs to make… Uh, body saves.

[Dex] 21:38:26
Yeah, alright.

[Ink] 21:38:27
Now, did we… we didn't recover any stress or anything like that, or…?

[GM] 21:38:31
Nope. It's as if, like, maybe, like, to you, you feel like you just went to sleep, and you've suddenly woken up.

[Ink] 21:38:32
No, okay, we just go right into it.

[Ink] 21:38:39
Okay, so there was… Oh, nice, Karna.

[GM] 21:38:40
You know… you know roughly that, like. Based on what you've been told, that… Um, about a month has passed.

[Dex] 21:38:48
Um, not too well.

[Ink] 21:38:53
Oh, wow.

[Dex] 21:38:54
And so what happens to, uh… and conducts.

[GM] 21:39:01
Um, you guys just have cryo sickness, so it'll wear off in, like, a week.

[GM] 21:39:05
Or you could take a Stimpak and… You can… you'll feel better.

[Dex] 21:39:09
A week. Do I have a Simpeak?

[GM] 21:39:12
You should, unless you used it in the… Cool.

[Dex] 21:39:14
Oh, I just… I didn't add it to my inventory.

[Zeke] 21:39:19
I assume my character is not making a role.

[GM] 21:39:21
No. Stimpacts are not reusable. One and done.

[Murderbot] 21:39:21
I'm not.

[Carnoc] 21:39:22
Are Stimpacts reusable? Or no.

[Ink] 21:39:32
Yeah, I don't have one in my equipment either.

[GM] 21:39:35
What are you guys doing? You got a Stimpak plus an SMG, plus a… Hazard suit…

[Ink] 21:39:42
I don't have a S&G.

[Murderbot] 21:39:42
I had Stimpex. Did someone take it off my body?

[Dex] 21:39:47
I never really added my SMG. I think… didn't we all end up with Paul's rifles, too?

[GM] 21:39:47
No, probably not. You did eventually end up with pulse rifles, um…

[Ink] 21:39:54
Okay, so I got my… Oh, I lost my pulse rifle, but I should still have my SMG.

[GM] 21:39:55
On account of… that's the… that's the stuff you salvaged from, uh… the…

[GM] 21:40:02
Sure. I mean, you can have a pulse rifle as well, because… The number of pulse rifles that were left in, um… at the Terraforming station were…

[GM] 21:40:14
12, and there are only… What, 1, 2, 3…

[GM] 21:40:20
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 survivors, and almost none of them are Marines.

[Dex] 21:40:25
On account of all the dead people we had a surplus of weapons.

[GM] 21:40:28
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:40:29
Okay.

[Dex] 21:40:30
What's… what's, um, what's a pulse rifle? Yeah.

[GM] 21:40:33
Like, the damage and stuff? Uh, does 3D10?

[GM] 21:40:45
There's my players. Um…

[Ink] 21:40:50
Oh, that's cool.

[GM] 21:40:51
Pulse rifle is…

[GM] 21:40:57
3% damage, um…

[Ink] 21:40:59
That's cryptic ammunition.

[GM] 21:41:03
Has 5… 5 shots, quote-unquote. I believe shots are just a… they're not actually representative of, like, the number of rounds in the…

[GM] 21:41:13
Um, but… And then it does gunshot wound.

[GM] 21:41:19
It's got a…

[Dex] 21:41:19
That's kind of just, like, a simplification of how many times you can… Like, how many rounds you can fire it on, I guess?

[GM] 21:41:26
Right, right. Um, and it has long range.

[Dex] 21:41:34
I guess I just put that in notes.

[GM] 21:41:40
Um…

[GM] 21:41:45
So, you notice that, like. For the most part, um… Everybody's waking up out of cryosleep at the same time. Um, however you don't notice.

[GM] 21:41:57
Moss, or Dr. Odem. With you. Um…

[GM] 21:42:05
So pretty much, like, all the… all the people you remember.

[GM] 21:42:08
Are here, uh, but except for them. Um…

[Ink] 21:42:13
Moss and Dr. Dem are missing.

[GM] 21:42:15
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 21:42:15
And Bertabot!

[Dex] 21:42:17
So does… what does cryoseness actually mean? Oh, well, I'm supposed to take a stress, right?

[GM] 21:42:24
No, no, you're not supposed to take trust. Feeling that. Feeling that just means you're… have cryosickness.

[Dex] 21:42:26
No, not fulfilling that. Okay.

[Ink] 21:42:30
Will it affect anything else that we do?

[GM] 21:42:32
Uh, yeah. You basically have disadvantage on everything?

[Ink] 21:42:40
So, probably worth taking a STEM path then.

[GM] 21:42:43
Only if you think you're gonna need to be fresh and ready to go right immediately.

[Ink] 21:42:47
Oh, within the… within a week, okay. So I could always take the STEM pack if we got into some action.

[GM] 21:42:48
Yeah. Right.

[Ink] 21:42:51
Real quick. Okay.

[GM] 21:42:55
I'm trying to figure out where… here, okay.

[Ink] 21:42:57
Then we're gonna stop by the store so we can spend these credits.

[GM] 21:43:01
Um, technically, you haven't been paid yet. Okay, so cryosickness is… while cryo-sick, you suffer disadvantage on all rolls for one week.

[Ink] 21:43:04
Oh.

[GM] 21:43:10
Upgraded cryo chambers can help mitigate these effects, and this impact can cure them instantly.

[GM] 21:43:19
Um… So, uh, you're on your ship, it's…

[GM] 21:43:26
You know, in the sort of same… kind of janky condition that you remember it. However, it's not…

[GM] 21:43:32
You can kind of tell that the engines have powered down, there's not this, like.

[GM] 21:43:35
Normal hum, uh, that's going when the engines are powered up.

[GM] 21:43:41
Um, you presume that you've been docked with some other larger ship, or, you know.

[GM] 21:43:46
Maybe even, um, in a hangar bay of a really large ship.

[GM] 21:43:50
Um, your ship is… pretty small. It's used just for transporting a small number of people.

[GM] 21:43:58
Um… You note that, uh…

[GM] 21:44:03
Someone has gone through your stuff and removed Hinton's logic core?

[GM] 21:44:10
Um… probably most likely, moss.

[GM] 21:44:15
Uh, it seems the likely candidate. He's probably off right now, uh, talking to the…

[GM] 21:44:21
His superiors about how good of a job he did in terms of getting… recovering Masa's core, or Hinton's core, and Dr. Adam.

[GM] 21:44:30
Um… As you're sort of, like, getting clothed.

[GM] 21:44:36
Um, and… kind of waking up, making some coffee, perhaps, on the ship.

[GM] 21:44:42
A company representative comes in, um. Sure. An airlock, uh, you could see that the much larger ship beyond is, um.

[GM] 21:44:53
Kind of much brighter, uh, seems like it's in better condition.

[GM] 21:44:57
The company rep tells you that, uh, Dr. Dem. Um, you've been quarantined for… a while just to…

[GM] 21:45:05
Allow for, uh, Dr. Adam to develop some tests, um. And make sure that, you know, you guys are not going to be subject to the…

[GM] 21:45:13
Kirk's sickness, as they've been calling it. Um, and so, actually, it's…

[GM] 21:45:20
You're informed that 2 months have actually passed? Since, uh… You guys completed your mission?

[GM] 21:45:27
So they kept you in cryo sleep while they ran tests on you, um, just to make sure that you're… you're okay.

[GM] 21:45:34
Um, turns out the… The cure actually worked. Um…

[GM] 21:45:40
You haven't shown any signs of. Transformation or anything, um… Actually, what they did was they, uh…

[GM] 21:45:48
They took Zeke's characters by… what's his name? Um… Zeke. They took Zeke out of cryosleep because he was comatose.

[GM] 21:45:58
Just let him sort of, like, see if he ever transformed.

[GM] 21:46:03
So, turns out he didn't, so, you know, they're… They're pretty… pretty satisfied.

[Zeke] 21:46:06
Yeah. I should get some money for being the medical guinea pig.

[Zeke] 21:46:12
It's like human trials. Clinical trials.

[Ink] 21:46:15
Yeah, look at your contract, sign at the bottom that you, uh… already that you signed away your medical rights there.

[GM] 21:46:23
Um. Yeah, so the, um…

[GM] 21:46:29
The company representative starts working through, like, your pay. Um, he invites each one of you individually to come meet in a room.

[GM] 21:46:39
Uh, he talks about… how, um, companies so grateful.

[GM] 21:46:44
For your service, you know. Here, you know, they agreed upon terms of your assignment, you know.

[GM] 21:46:50
I believe it was 2… 2 months. Of hazard pay, plus one month of, uh, normal pay.

[Dex] 21:46:58
And what about that month of quarantine.

[GM] 21:46:58
Um, they calculate it out, and… Oh, but, you know, that they're gonna call that a wash on account if they kept you on life support during that time, so…

[GM] 21:47:08
Um, you know, it's like, no time passed for you, but the company had to expend resources while you're under.

[GM] 21:47:14
Yeah, to run the electrical system, you know. Pump some saline into your body's, you know, IV.

[GM] 21:47:20
Boy, actually, it's probably best that we don't try to calculate this out, because… it'll probably come out in debt as a result of it, so…

[Dex] 21:47:28
This is so depressing. I don't say that out loud.

[GM] 21:47:35
Um… So, um…

[Dex] 21:47:36
But I look at…

[GM] 21:47:42
They look at, uh… the contract that Zeke had signed, um, and knowing, like, the amount of…

[GM] 21:47:49
Human resources that, uh, have… or how many resources have gone into developing Zeek's, uh.

[GM] 21:47:55
Big brain, um… They run Zeke through, uh…

[Zeke] 21:47:57
Yeah.

[GM] 21:48:01
One of the, um… what are they called?

[GM] 21:48:07
Here. Med… med pods? Um, and… so Zeke gets to remove the wound of being.

[GM] 21:48:16
Catatonic? I don't know. What did we say it was? Oh, no, no, it wasn't… it's not a MedPod, that restores a wound. You have a…

[GM] 21:48:24
Um… cognitive defragmentation they have to run you through.

[GM] 21:48:31
I need you to roll a D1. And don't roll a 1% chance, or it's real bad for you.

[Zeke] 21:48:36
Well, you know, I thought it was dead a second ago, so…

[GM] 21:48:39
Just on a 1, don't roll a 1, Zeke.

[Zeke] 21:48:44
I think I could handle that, but… It's not a one.

[GM] 21:48:47
Okay, you didn't… you didn't roll one. You did roll a critical failure, though.

[Zeke] 21:48:52
It's just true.

[Dex] 21:48:54
Is that a failure?

[Carnoc] 21:48:55
Yeah. Well, I mean…

[GM] 21:48:55
Uh, no, the… no, the only failure was rolling 1… 1% chance.

[Dex] 21:48:59
Okay, because there's not really a target on that one, that's just a bunch of random stuff, or…?

[GM] 21:49:04
Um…

[Dex] 21:49:05
Wait, is this actually something different happens on all 100 values, or is it… just, like, a target.

[GM] 21:49:11
Wait, for this particular role? This role was just to see if he had total amnesia.

[Dex] 21:49:13
Yeah. Oh, okay.

[GM] 21:49:17
Yeah, so it's kind of like coming out of cryo sleep. It's not actually a failure that causes you stress, it's just, like.

[GM] 21:49:24
Did this outcome happen? It's not really a… a save or a check.

[GM] 21:49:28
Um, alright, so after 24 hours of treatment, Zeke. Is awake.

[GM] 21:49:35
Um… Those cognitive defragmentation.

[Dex] 21:49:35
And you called that cognitive defragmentation?

[Carnoc] 21:49:36
Welcome back, Zeke!

[Zeke] 21:49:38
Whoa.

[Dex] 21:49:43
Does he have temporary amnesia?

[GM] 21:49:45
No, but he has disadvantage on intelligence checks, sanity saves, and fear saves for 4 weeks.

[Dex] 21:49:50
4 weeks.

[Carnoc] 21:49:51
Oof.

[Zeke] 21:49:51
Oh, um… trying to remember where I put my…

[Zeke] 21:49:57
Things… uh, didn't I have… hat…

[Carnoc] 21:49:59
Well, if you learned anything, don't hook yourself up to a robot brain.

[GM] 21:50:04
Yeah, occasionally, Zeke, you get… flashes of, like… Hinton part of his life and shit.

[GM] 21:50:13
Um, nothing that ever sticks in such a way that you could… that would be useful to you.

[Zeke] 21:50:17
Yeah.

[GM] 21:50:19
Um, but that's, like, kind of what you're dealing with, is at times you feel as if you're not yourself.

[GM] 21:50:23
You feel like you're somebody else?

[GM] 21:50:31
Um.

[Dex] 21:50:32
What was it, disadvantaged Zone Intelligence Tech said any saves, and what?

[GM] 21:50:36
Pure saves for 4 weeks. Um, unfortunately, uh…

[Dex] 21:50:40
So, uh, what'd they charge you for all that, Zeke?

[GM] 21:50:43
Yeah, unfortunately, your medical plan did not cover, uh, cognitive defragmentation, and as such, you're… your, um, deductible, which was quite high, uh.

[GM] 21:50:56
It was fully, uh… was fully paid out by your pay, but you now owe the company, uh, 20,000 credits.

[Zeke] 21:51:05
I go to the in-network. Defragmenter.

[GM] 21:51:09
Well, it's too late, um…

[Zeke] 21:51:14
It would make sense at the company spaceship would have the out-of-network defragmenter.

[Zeke] 21:51:19
For the company's health plan. I could believe that.

[GM] 21:51:25
Um, so the, uh…

[GM] 21:51:30
Do you guys get paid, um… the company says, you know.

[GM] 21:51:36
Obviously, because every… Who doesn't have a wound?

[GM] 21:51:40
Is it just, uh, Karnak? Or just kind of recap a wound.

[Murderbot] 21:51:43
For me…

[Carnoc] 21:51:44
I don't… I don't have a wound.

[GM] 21:51:46
Okay. But does everybody else have a wound?

[Dex] 21:51:49
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:51:51
I don't… I don't have a wound. That's right, I guess, yeah, I'm trying to think when I was talking to Dex afterwards.

[GM] 21:51:53
No? Okay. That's fine.

[Ink] 21:52:00
I didn't think of… couldn't think of when I have. Somehow, I ink-dodged everything.

[GM] 21:52:05
Okay, that's fine. Um…

[Dex] 21:52:07
Like, I got booted, like, as early as we could have possibly gotten wounded.

[GM] 21:52:10
Do you have more than one wound? Just one, okay.

[Dex] 21:52:13
No, just one.

[Ink] 21:52:14
No, you didn't… you didn't bonk your head in the spaceship going down, like, uh… like BurgerBot did.

[Dex] 21:52:19
Okay, that's right. It's not as early as possible. I could have done earlier.

[Dex] 21:52:24
It was still the first session then.

[GM] 21:52:24
Um… Uh… Yeah, and I guess as far as MurderBot goes, you…

[GM] 21:52:32
You know, being on the ship is a little bit, um… Hard not to be a little torn up by the fact that you see a bunch of murder bots walking around.

[GM] 21:52:42
Sort of absentmindedly, totally disregarding you guys and your presence. Um…

[Dex] 21:52:47
Like, they really look just like him.

[Murderbot] 21:52:48
Murder, murder, murder.

[GM] 21:52:51
They walk around and say murder.

[Dex] 21:52:52
Just like he used to say it.

[Murderbot] 21:52:58
Uh-huh.

[GM] 21:52:58
The company tells you that they, uh, do have, um, another mission ready for you, and… you know, for those of you who.

[GM] 21:53:09
May have to go into debt as part of your medical needs. Uh, this might… This may help, uh, alleviate some of that financial pain.

[GM] 21:53:18
Um, but they… they say, you know, take some time, uh, there's no rush on this.

[GM] 21:53:24
Um… But we'd like to offer you another job.

[Zeke] 21:53:30
I negotiate my contract because. In this last mission, I came out with less money than I started.

[Zeke] 21:53:37
So, if that happens again, this is not such a good career opportunity.

[Zeke] 21:53:43
Um… like, some clause in there that if I get injured on company time, that…

[Ink] 21:53:49
Wait, you can always quit and go to another company when you get out of debt.

[Zeke] 21:53:52
Right.

[Murderbot] 21:53:53
Ooh…

[Dex] 21:53:53
Are there other companies?

[GM] 21:53:55
Uh, there are subsidiaries of the company. None of them are generally in competition with one another.

[Dex] 21:53:59
Oh, okay.

[GM] 21:54:10
Because contrary to popular belief. The end goal of capitalism is not a completely competitive market, but one giant monopoly.

[GM] 21:54:19
Owned by the biggest… biggest tech company that there could possibly be.

[Zeke] 21:54:20
Close.

[Zeke] 21:54:25
Getting there.

[GM] 21:54:29
Um… Alright, well, I have to… I have to generate a contract real quick.

[Ink] 21:54:34
Nah, no… no empire ever survives three generations.

[Murderbot] 21:54:39
Oh, Jesus.

[GM] 21:54:41
What if… what if, uh… Well, tech bros are running it, then maybe it would.

[Zeke] 21:54:45
Go to the bathroom.

[Ink] 21:54:47
The children always mess it up, or the grandkids do.

[Dex] 21:54:50
Well, it's been run by the same AI for 500 years.

[Ink] 21:54:54
There we go. You have loaded yourself to the machine.

[GM] 21:54:56
Um…

[GM] 21:55:02
So, I'm taking this moment as just sort of a break, if you guys want to, like.

[GM] 21:55:09
Uh… if you… you don't have to, like, so, some of you came out without wounds and thus don't have necessarily, like, financial hardship in a way that you'd have to be, uh, participating in the next mission.

[GM] 21:55:19
Um, so if you wanted to, like, generate a new character, or… Um, I don't know.

[GM] 21:55:26
Change it up in some way, you're welcome to. Um, the only character…

[GM] 21:55:33
But I think from… you could play any of the, uh, surviving members of… Um, the previous mission, um, if you wanted to bring them into the game, except for Sergeant Yang, is about the only.

[GM] 21:55:45
Character that I think… I think Ben might want to play Sergeant Yang, uh, if he plays with us, so… he's sort of off-limits for the moment.

[Dex] 21:55:49
Okay.

[GM] 21:55:53
Uh, but… If you wanted to switch characters, or whatever, um…

[Murderbot] 21:55:57
I don't want to play Yang.

[GM] 21:56:00
I just… You're gonna play Novikov.

[Murderbot] 21:56:04
He sounds Asian.

[Ink] 21:56:07
I think we really want another MurderBot, though. Just reboot Murderbot.

[Murderbot] 21:56:12
Alright, I'll take… I'll take Murderbot. Only… only if he's got superpowers!

[Dex] 21:56:18
I think it would just be a better bed without memories of the previous mission. Who owes more money now?

[Ink] 21:56:25
Well, he's owned by the company, right?

[Murderbot] 21:56:25
I don't owe money? I am the corporate property. I owe no… nothing to no one.

[GM] 21:56:33
Um… Well, Murderbot, actually…

[Murderbot] 21:56:35
Wait, is that… is that true, GM? Okay, there we go, alright. So, Vertebrot does no money to anybody. Okay.

[GM] 21:56:38
You are company property, yes. Yeah.

[Dex] 21:56:42
Oh, really?

[GM] 21:56:46
He doesn't owe money to anybody, but here's what we will do, though. Um… So, as a demonstration of, like.

[Murderbot] 21:56:50
Yeah.

[GM] 21:56:54
To kind of, like, how leveling up works. You have your MurderBot sheet, right?

[Murderbot] 21:56:59
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 21:57:00
And you have the stress on that street sheet?

[Murderbot] 21:57:05
Let's see here… Oh, yeah, I got sick stress and 1 resolve.

[Murderbot] 21:57:11
Or one wound.

[GM] 21:57:13
Okay, well, I mean, the wounds don't count, because you have a whole new body. There's a whole new murder bot.

[Murderbot] 21:57:17
Yeah, nor do the stresses, sir.

[GM] 21:57:20
No, but the stress is how you level up.

[Ink] 21:57:24
You want stress.

[Murderbot] 21:57:24
Oh, okay. And I got lots of stress.

[GM] 21:57:27
Do you probably have more than 6, you just weren't counting.

[Ink] 21:57:30
Yeah, because I got sick.

[Murderbot] 21:57:30
Oh, yeah, I… I blew up at some point, so…

[GM] 21:57:34
Uh, that's okay. We're doing this as just a demonstration to everybody about.

[GM] 21:57:38
What taking shore relieve actually does for you, so… Um, so… Normally, you would pay short leave costs, but here, the company's, like, essentially, you're getting a mildly upgraded murder bot.

[Murderbot] 21:57:42
Okay.

[GM] 21:57:52
Um, you make a sanity save. So go ahead and make a sanity save.

[Murderbot] 21:57:52
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 21:58:00
Sanity. Sanity, sanity. Sanity, sanity. And it's right there.

[GM] 21:58:06
And you could do it with just… or with Advantage, so you can roll twice.

[Dex] 21:58:14
Those saves don't… Save Stone Coast stress when you fail, but skills do.

[Murderbot] 21:58:15
No modifier, right?

[GM] 21:58:19
Uh, I think saves cause stress when you fail. Yeah, okay. So, this is a critical success.

[Dex] 21:58:21
Uh, saves also do platform.

[Ink] 21:58:26
Whoo! Nice job, VBAC!

[Dex] 21:58:27
Nice. Oh, you change your name to V2?

[Murderbot] 21:58:27
Woohoo!

[Carnoc] 21:58:27
Ooh, ooh…

[GM] 21:58:28
Yeah, 22.

[Murderbot] 21:58:32
Yep.

[GM] 21:58:34
So what you do now is you convert the maximum amount of stress allowed at the port into improved saves and relieve the remainder. So, um… the type of port that you guys will be going to…

[GM] 21:58:46
Uh, will be a class export. So that means that you can heal up to…

[GM] 21:58:56
14 stress. So, you convert all of your stress up to 14 into.

[GM] 21:59:03
Um… Improve saves.

[GM] 21:59:07
So for every point of stress you convert, you can improve any save by 1.

[GM] 21:59:11
You can divide these improvements up however you want. So… if you had 14 stress, you could put it all into sanity. If you had 14…

[GM] 21:59:20
You could split it up amongst sanity, fear, or body. Okay.

[Murderbot] 21:59:24
Okay. Um, what was… I mean, do I go with 6, or do I go… is there a number that you want me to use for stress?

[GM] 21:59:34
Well, I mean…

[Murderbot] 21:59:35
I think I did a lot… I saved a lot, because I don't… the fear seems like I saved a bunch, but I don't know if that's stress, but… Right now, it says 6.

[GM] 21:59:44
Here's the thing, we haven't… Can I quickly search this?

[GM] 21:59:50
I might actually be able to quickly search this. So, um…

[GM] 21:59:56
Basically, I have the log. I don't know if you guys have the log of the entire games thus far.

[GM] 22:00:03
If you scroll up in the chat log, does it go eventually up to the chat archive?

[Carnoc] 22:00:11
Yeah…

[Murderbot] 22:00:12
Let's go over the top. It says, view all chat entries for this game.

[Dex] 22:00:12
You all chat entries. Yeah, I can click on that.

[GM] 22:00:17
Alright, so if you view all chat entries, and then you do, essentially, a Ctrl-F for.

[Murderbot] 22:00:22
Yeah, for MurderBot.

[GM] 22:00:24
Murderbot, and then you can look at all the ones that you failed versus saved.

[GM] 22:00:28
You can figure out if you had more. More stress you should have accumulated.

[Murderbot] 22:00:28
Okay. Thank you so much.

[Ink] 22:00:36
Who's Ido Ohan?

[Murderbot] 22:00:37
Robots at chatty bastard. Sophontology…

[GM] 22:00:39
Uh, that's, uh, Ben's character. It's… it's not actually the character's name, it's just the… auto-generated name.

[Ink] 22:00:42
Gotcha, I can pick him for some reason as one of my people.

[Murderbot] 22:00:46
I'm gonna say…

[Ink] 22:00:48
That can be it.

[GM] 22:00:48
Yeah, that's because, uh, because he hasn't logged in yet. I haven't been able to set him as a player in the game.

[GM] 22:00:56
Because he just has the link to the game right now.

[Dex] 22:01:00
I must just set it at 8, but I'm only getting 6 hits on decks. Maybe I rolled as me instead, sometimes.

[GM] 22:01:08
Yeah, it's possible. You can… I mean, also search for Dex, and, you know…

[Dex] 22:01:12
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:01:15
Um, I only got 3. Three hits on stuff.

[Murderbot] 22:01:21
That I failed.

[GM] 22:01:23
Well, maybe it doesn't have the full log. Maybe it only goes back to…

[Dex] 22:01:25
Boom. I think it's…

[Murderbot] 22:01:26
Yeah, I'll stick with 6 then. I don't… I mean, that's the last number I have, so…

[GM] 22:01:30
Let's see…

[Murderbot] 22:01:34
It's not like you increase too stress at a time, right? It's… you start… increase one stress at a time.

[GM] 22:01:40
Eh, this seems like… Oh yeah, that's not like a lot of rules.

[Murderbot] 22:01:47
What did everybody else have that stress? Is this too high? Too low? Oh, okay.

[Ink] 22:01:49
I got 6. 6 probably is too low, but you had to fail. I didn't… I think you probably rolled more than I did, because you kept smacking your head on shit.

[Carnoc] 22:02:00
I've got… I got 14, but I kept shooting our allies.

[Dex] 22:02:05
It's also hard to tell, because if you. If you roll with either advantage or disadvantage, it doesn't tell you which one the result was.

[Murderbot] 22:02:13
Weird. Huh. I didn't learn… I didn't… I didn't rule that much.

[Dex] 22:02:16
Because, like, checking the box just means you rolled twice, but you don't know which one it was.

[GM] 22:02:22
I mean, it's also possible that the log doesn't have… Um, our entire…

[Murderbot] 22:02:23
I got one for…

[GM] 22:02:31
Game? But…

[Murderbot] 22:02:31
Our entire game. Hmm.

[Ink] 22:02:37
Well, you'll keep track of it this time, won't you, Murderbot?

[GM] 22:02:40
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:02:40
I thought I did! I thought I was doing well. I'm at 6, I say, I'll just keep it at 6.

[Ink] 22:02:45
You might, I just…

[Murderbot] 22:02:48
I'll just say 6, GM.

[GM] 22:02:48
Yeah, because there's some stuff, like… Yeah, I don't know.

[Murderbot] 22:02:56
And 26. Okay, done. And so stress goes back to zero?

[GM] 22:03:00
And stress goes to the, um… Two, yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:03:03
Oh, two.

[Dex] 22:03:04
Mine's pretty close, like, I had 8 on my sheet, and it would be somewhere between 8 and 10, depending on whether my… Roles for advantage or disadvantage.

[GM] 22:03:13
Yeah. That's fine. I mean, you know… Um, so that's… that's how…

[GM] 22:03:21
This works. Um…

[GM] 22:03:27
Alright, marginally increased… Murderbot.

[Murderbot] 22:03:27
Man, that's not… not… Not a lot.

[GM] 22:03:34
So…

[Murderbot] 22:03:34
I don't like this.

[Ink] 22:03:34
Get to improve our saves, but not our strength speeding to, like, combat. Those are stat… are stat… Gotcha.

[GM] 22:03:40
Those are… those are static.

[Dex] 22:03:43
What made it so that the… cryo, sleep, check, roll, didn't impact stress.

[Murderbot] 22:03:43
I don't like this stuff, Perry.

[GM] 22:03:50
Like, why wasn't that body safe? A failure for stress, it's because… I mean, like, it actually might technically be, um… gotta eke out all that stress you want to have.

[Dex] 22:03:52
Yeah.

[GM] 22:04:02
Um, but really, like, the check is… or the save is mostly just to figure out if you're under that, um, effect or not.

[Dex] 22:04:10
Okay. I was just asking, because one of the things on my to-do list is to see if I can get the stress to automatically increment if the roll fails.

[GM] 22:04:21
Mmm, I see. Um, let's see. Let me check my…

[GM] 22:04:29
Okay, how do I gain stress? You gain one stress every time you fill a stat, check, or save.

[Dex] 22:04:29
But yeah, we can…

[GM] 22:04:33
Occasionally, certain locations, entities can automatically give you stress. Your minimum stress is 2, and based on that.

[GM] 22:04:40
What happens in the game, panic checking results. So, I guess technically, if you fail your body save, you could gain stress, but…

[GM] 22:04:48
I don't think that's necessary unless you want it. So, one of the nice things, I think, about Mothership's design is that.

[GM] 22:04:55
The stress acts as, like, an incentive for you to, like, attempt things that might be slightly foolish.

[GM] 22:05:01
Uh, by being the currency for leveling up, but at the same time, it also has this.

[Dex] 22:05:04
Yeah.

[GM] 22:05:05
Really possibly negative outcome of panic. So… but that adds to the drama of the game, so…

[Dex] 22:05:09
Right.

[GM] 22:05:18
Okay, um… Zeke, you might have been out of the room, but I was basically saying that, you know, this is a moment to figure out if you want to keep playing the same character, if you want to switch it up at all.

[GM] 22:05:30
Um, and… He's not dead yet. Cognitive defrag.

[Zeke] 22:05:32
Oh, I'll play, my guy's not dead yet. Just didn't do it.

[Zeke] 22:05:38
Plenty of opportunity for him to die.

[Dex] 22:05:39
So what is… So Murderbot doesn't owe money, because…

[Carnoc] 22:05:39
So is this, like, a choice?

[Dex] 22:05:45
He's owned by the company, he doesn't have money, or…

[GM] 22:05:49
Um, he does not have money. Is owned by the company.

[Dex] 22:05:54
So… Okay. But he…

[Dex] 22:06:00
Does he remember anything from the last mission we did? No? Okay.

[GM] 22:06:03
No. No. No, this is a whole new Android.

[Dex] 22:06:08
Okay. Oh, okay. So he doesn't have, like, any memories whatsoever? Like, not even.

[Murderbot] 22:06:09
I am Murderbot.

[Dex] 22:06:13
Before we went down to the shuttle.

[GM] 22:06:16
Nope. You could maybe upgrade him with some, like, uh…

[Murderbot] 22:06:17
It is nice to meet you. That we play a game.

[GM] 22:06:24
Backup, uh, downloader. Where it's like…

[Dex] 22:06:26
But he looks, like, creepily exactly the same. Okay.

[GM] 22:06:29
Yes.

[Carnoc] 22:06:33
So if her characters go on shore leave. Can they still play the next mission, or is that, like, them sitting out for…

[Murderbot] 22:06:34
Does my face haunt you?

[GM] 22:06:39
No, no, no. Um… The shore leave part is actually going to be built into the…

[Carnoc] 22:06:40
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:06:46
The mission, in a way.

[Carnoc] 22:06:49
So are we all doing short leave right now, or just Murderbot?

[Dex] 22:06:52
Does that cost money?

[GM] 22:06:53
Not yet, not doing. Yes, it'll… it'll cost money to do shortly.

[Carnoc] 22:06:55
Okay.

[GM] 22:07:00
Um, I'll be right back.

[GM] 22:09:22
Zeke, did you come up with what you wanted to negotiate for your contract?

[Zeke] 22:09:27
Oh, um… No. Um, I…

[Dex] 22:09:30
You were just assuming it was going to get denied.

[Zeke] 22:09:32
I just, yeah, I figured any… any attempt at negotiation was going to be denied by the company.

[Zeke] 22:09:37
Um… I mean, I… hmm?

[GM] 22:09:40
Perhaps you should listen to the mission details before you decide what you're… your contract should look like.

[Zeke] 22:09:46
That seems like a reasonable plan, yeah.

[GM] 22:09:48
That's what the company lawyer says to you.

[Dex] 22:09:49
Oh, like, for the next mission?

[Zeke] 22:09:54
Um, well, um… My own lawyer tells me that.

[Zeke] 22:10:00
I'm in, uh… prime bargaining position, because… Uh, the company could be, uh…

[Zeke] 22:10:08
Experiencing a lawsuit soon due to the damage that was done.

[Zeke] 22:10:13
To my brain.

[GM] 22:10:15
You know that hiring an outside attorney is a violation of any company contract, right?

[Zeke] 22:10:22
Wow. It's a good thing there's… That's right.

[Dex] 22:10:22
I thought you were just gonna tell us that all law firms are subsidiaries of the company.

[Murderbot] 22:10:22
Why did you sign it, you dummy?

[GM] 22:10:27
Exactly.

[Zeke] 22:10:32
This company kind of sucks. Gotta say.

[GM] 22:10:37
Ink's out of the room. Uh, so I'll just do the setup. So… Um… You're allowed off the ship and, um…

[GM] 22:10:47
The ship that you're… you're docked with is obviously much larger and much newer.

[GM] 22:10:53
Much more expensive. It's bright, um, there's this sort of element of, like.

[GM] 22:11:00
Cleanliness to it, you know, it's not dark. Even the air quality seems higher, there's probably, like.

[GM] 22:11:06
Numerous filters and, um, there might even be a green space on the ship where they're actually generating their own oxygen.

[GM] 22:11:15
Um, and so, uh… It's pretty impressive.

[GM] 22:11:20
Uh, you know that as part of the… being a part of the company, that this is not, um… an unusual thing for that to be high-quality ships, but, um…

[GM] 22:11:29
You know, it's not often that anybody in your position gets to see something like this.

[GM] 22:11:36
Um, and so… Ironically, you're taken into a room, and it's kind of filled with smoke. I mean, it's not… there's, like, a guy who's sitting across the table, he's got, like, a pack of cigarettes sitting on the table, and he's just smoking real hard.

[GM] 22:11:51
Um. Now, compared to our current.

[GM] 22:11:56
Ideas about smoking, like, the future, like, this guy's like, yeah, you know, cancer, they'll just fix that. You just jump in a… MedPod, and, you know, you'll be fine, so…

[GM] 22:12:05
Uh, this indulgence doesn't seem out of place, and even, like, the smoking and the impacts on the air quality for the entire ship seem.

[GM] 22:12:13
Like, he's unconcerned about that. Um…

[Dex] 22:12:16
This is, like, the same company rep, or a new guy?

[GM] 22:12:18
This is a new guy. Um.

[GM] 22:12:24
He brings you guys into the room, uh… or someone brings you into the room with this guy, and he's got, essentially, like, a manila folder on the table, um.

[GM] 22:12:33
Which is really kind of low-tech for the time, you know, um… But he essentially says, you know.

[GM] 22:12:42
What's the subsidiary? Um… Corporation is Straitmeyer?

[GM] 22:12:52
The Straitmeyer Group, um. Has… found that there are pirates running an illegal drug out of an unknown space base.

[GM] 22:13:05
They know… this because they caught a, uh, transport.

[GM] 22:13:11
A freighter with a bunch of Teamsters on it, and when they went through the cargo, they found this drug.

[GM] 22:13:18
Um, so after some interrogation of the Teamsters. They found out that, um…

[GM] 22:13:25
This highly addictive substance. Was being generated on a base called… a space station called Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 22:13:35
Um… the thing is, is that no one's ever been able to find Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 22:13:40
Um, they've done… several scans of the nearby sector, um…

[GM] 22:13:45
And they've never been able to come across it, even with the help of… the Teamsters that… or even with the knowledge that Teamsters gave them.

[GM] 22:13:55
Um, but they've recently cracked one of the Teamsters, and apparently the.

[GM] 22:14:00
The base itself… can't be detected unless you have.

[GM] 22:14:05
A specific… Frequency and data transmit that you have, like…

[GM] 22:14:10
No specific code, you can get to the base. So, um, the company wants…

[GM] 22:14:17
And specifically the Straitmeyer Group wants you to, um… fly with this Teamster.

[GM] 22:14:24
Back to, um… Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 22:14:29
And ingratiate yourself with the leaders there. Figure out how this drug is being.

[GM] 22:14:36
Um, produced. And, on top of that.

[GM] 22:14:42
Um, if you can, assassinate the leadership of this. And or figure out, like, how… You might get some assassins on board.

[GM] 22:14:51
Um… They note the fact that DEX is wounded. They said they actually kind of want you guys beat up in beat-up condition.

[GM] 22:15:00
Stressed out. Um, you know, because it'll make it seem…

[GM] 22:15:05
More real, the cover story that they'd like you to adopt, which is that… you're disenfranchised with the company.

[GM] 22:15:11
You're upset with your wages and your, your, uh… your pay, and uh… that… Um, you're effectively defecting from the company.

[GM] 22:15:21
You've freed this Teamster that we're sending with you. Um, and so you want to essentially join up with them.

[Ink] 22:15:30
And our ship's kind of crummy.

[GM] 22:15:33
Um… He kind of gives you a sideways look about that comment. He's like.

[GM] 22:15:38
That's fair, compared to the ship that we're on right now, that's… that's a reasonable assumption, but… I've seen some bad ships, so… it's…

[GM] 22:15:47
You know, you got life support. Some people don't even have that.

[GM] 22:15:53
Um, so that's the mission. Take this Teamster, go to Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 22:15:58
Figure out how they're making the drugs. Possibly either assassinate the leadership if it's easy.

[GM] 22:16:05
Or, um… somehow transmit back how you could get an assassination, or assassin crew onto the ship.

[GM] 22:16:13
Take them out. It says, mind you, this is all… you know, I use the word assassinate, it's not outside of, uh, it's not extra legal.

[GM] 22:16:22
You know, the company, this is, you know, a pirate. Base operating an illegal drug.

[GM] 22:16:29
So, you know, this is all well within our jurisdiction to handle.

[Ink] 22:16:36
What's this guy look like?

[GM] 22:16:38
Uh, he looks like the Smoky Man from, uh, X-Files.

[Ink] 22:16:48
All right, I'm in, I grabbed the file.

[GM] 22:16:52
Just immediately.

[Ink] 22:16:55
You gonna give us, uh, you got any additional equipment or anything for us to… Help us succeed.

[GM] 22:17:00
But as you put your hand on the file to, like, pull it towards your side, he puts his hand on it, kind of slow you down, he's like.

[GM] 22:17:06
We… we do need to negotiate contracts here.

[Zeke] 22:17:09
Yeah, and I think we should unionize for the purpose of this negotiation.

[GM] 22:17:13
One of you is already in the union, kind of indicates Dex has, uh… being a Teamster.

[Dex] 22:17:21
Is an ink, also.

[Ink] 22:17:22
Yeah, I'm part of the union.

[GM] 22:17:24
Oh, yeah, you're a teaser too? Okay. Yeah. He indicates, like, yeah, you guys, you already have some people in the union.

[GM] 22:17:33
Their contracts are already predetermined here. They're not getting anything else.

[Dex] 22:17:38
That doesn't sound like how that should work.

[GM] 22:17:42
The unions already negotiated your contract on your behalf.

[Ink] 22:17:47
Yep, the union leader got paid off, and we all got screwed, you know, how good?

[GM] 22:17:54
And indicating to, uh, um… Karnock that, you know.

[GM] 22:18:00
Uh, Carnex probably, uh… still having to serve off his, like, military training time. It's like 6…

[GM] 22:18:07
6 tours or something that he has to serve on, so… He's already in for whatever the normal pay is for him, but yeah.

[GM] 22:18:17
Zeke's contract is about the only one up for negotiation, given that you're a scientist.

[Zeke] 22:18:22
Well, given the need for a well-trained biologist on this mission due to the nature of the drug that we're investigating.

[Zeke] 22:18:30
I feel… I feel that my skills are highly in demand.

[GM] 22:18:33
Yep.

[Zeke] 22:18:35
Um, so… At a minimum, I want my regular pay, plus…

[Zeke] 22:18:41
Uh, any injuries… Uh, that I receive as a result of this mission should be covered, uh, fully.

[Zeke] 22:18:49
By the company, unless they have to be outsourced to some other organization. If the company can cover my medical care.

[Zeke] 22:18:55
Using company technology, company facilities, and I think it should be fully covered.

[GM] 22:19:01
Okay. And we'll wipe your $20,000 debt, too.

[Zeke] 22:19:06
Perfect. You can answer that.

[GM] 22:19:09
That's because you forgot about it. I'm just here to remind you that that does exist.

[GM] 22:19:17
Um, he, you know, there's no paper form here. He pulls out, like, an electronic, um.

[GM] 22:19:24
Effectively, iPad. Punches in, like, to a prefab form of a contract.

[GM] 22:19:30
And then he slides it across the table to you. Uh, you look through it, it's exactly as you've asked. There aren't any kind of loopholes or anything, he's not trying to pull any kind of…

[GM] 22:19:40
Um, wool over your eyes, it's… Exactly what you're… you're asking for.

[Zeke] 22:19:46
Sounds good.

[GM] 22:19:46
Any kind of wounds or anything that you take, uh, they'll be taken care of by the… The company, you get your normal pay, which in this case.

[GM] 22:19:53
Uh, they are offering, essentially, 4 months of hazard pay. Um, and, uh, on top of that, they'll wipe your 20K debt.

[Zeke] 22:20:04
I will sign a contract.

[GM] 22:20:05
Okay. Um, alright.

[Dex] 22:20:10
So the rest of us don't get that deal with the injuries paid for.

[GM] 22:20:14
No, but they kind of need you injured. Um… So that it looks… it looks real.

[Dex] 22:20:17
Good. So I can't even reduce my stress, because I shouldn't.

[GM] 22:20:19
You know. Uh, well, there's no, um…

[GM] 22:20:27
To hear tell of the… of Prospero's dream, they have a significant shore leaf.

[GM] 22:20:31
Um, you know, you've been told that there's no rush on this mission.

[GM] 22:20:36
Um… They do, uh, expect.

[GM] 22:20:39
Probably you guys to check in in probably about a year.

[GM] 22:20:43
Um… which… you know, that's also including flight time, so, you know, you might only have, like, a few months on base before you need to come back.

[GM] 22:20:54
Or chicken in some way. Um…

[GM] 22:20:59
As far as additional gear. Um, is there anything in particular that you're looking for?

[Dex] 22:21:12
Well, I mean, do we have any… How do we think we're gonna get this frequency and data to transmit to find the station? Like, do you…

[Dex] 22:21:21
Have contacts, we can do some surveillance on. Or… any leads on that?

[GM] 22:21:28
Um… Well, you'll have this Teamster we're sending you with.

[GM] 22:21:34
Um, and then beyond that, and you may want to eliminate him when you get to the base, because.

[GM] 22:21:41
He is the only one that will know that you're working for us.

[GM] 22:21:46
Just… just saying. Um… As far as transmission goes, uh, we assume that you'll just.

[GM] 22:21:52
End up having to leave, commandeer a ship and return to this, uh, this fleet.

[Dex] 22:21:58
Okay. So this Timster knows the frequency.

[GM] 22:22:05
Yeah. He bargained that he could get you guys onto the…

[GM] 22:22:11
Prospero's dream, without getting caught. The rest of his crew, uh, are…

[GM] 22:22:18
Being held. As sort of collateral in case this mission fails.

[Ink] 22:22:23
All right, uh, STEM packs. I want some STEM packs? That's, that's the first thing on my list.

[Murderbot] 22:22:30
GM, what is my mission from corporate?

[Ink] 22:22:34
But yeah, we want a new MurderBot, too.

[GM] 22:22:35
The…

[GM] 22:22:40
Funny you should ask, and he, like, motions, and the door opens, and, uh, you know.

[GM] 22:22:44
Version 2 comes in. Um, you're… you're…

[GM] 22:22:51
Your mission is effectively… is this the new Murderbot? Um, your mission is effectively to make sure that this mission succeeds, you know.

[GM] 22:23:00
Get them on board, Prospero's dream, find out where the drug is.

[GM] 22:23:06
Um, how the drug is manufactured. Kill the leadership if it's easy, or, you know, get back and figure out.

[GM] 22:23:13
A way to get an assassination team on board.

[Murderbot] 22:23:18
Who is the appointed leader of this mission?

[GM] 22:23:22
Um… Yeah, that's a good question.

[Dex] 22:23:29
Can you spell straight my heart.

[Murderbot] 22:23:30
Who's… who's… whose instructions must I follow?

[GM] 22:23:34
Uh, we're gonna say Carnox.

[Murderbot] 22:23:37
Affirmative.

[GM] 22:23:42
There were reports that Zeke was a little too, uh, independently thinking on this, but Karnox seemed to follow orders.

[GM] 22:23:50
Uh, and even risked… risked himself. Uh, life and limb and the pursuit of the accomplishment of the mission.

[Zeke] 22:23:57
I plugged myself into a giant. Artificial intelligence.

[GM] 22:24:03
Yeah, they don't want you, like, running the murder bot.

[Zeke] 22:24:08
Be right back.

[GM] 22:24:10
Um…

[Murderbot] 22:24:12
Third, the public trust protects the innocent. Uphold the law.

[Ink] 22:24:19
GM, how do we… how do we up our skills? Or gain new skills.

[GM] 22:24:20
Uh…

[GM] 22:24:24
Uh, gaining new skills. Trained skills take 2 years plus 10 kilocredits.

[GM] 22:24:29
Expert skills take 4… 4 years, plus 50 kilocredits. And Master Skills take 6 years plus 200 kilocredits.

[Murderbot] 22:24:30
God damn!

[Ink] 22:24:36
So when we're walking through, I saw the thing where they could hook up to your brain and accelerate the learning process in one of those other rooms.

[GM] 22:24:43
Uh, that's illegal tech right there.

[Ink] 22:24:46
I mean, it doesn't look like this room is very legal. Can we get a… Or this mission.

[Murderbot] 22:24:52
We're splicing.

[GM] 22:24:54
When we started dealing in cyber mods. You know, that would… that would.

[Murderbot] 22:24:57
Can't we… can't we get Murderbot version 10?

[GM] 22:25:03
The company… you know that the company is not sure that this mission will succeed, so they're not willing to, like, waste.

[GM] 22:25:11
Such a high valuable asset with this team.

[Murderbot] 22:25:12
Ah, son of a bitch! What is it? What if they think you'd be more successful if they brought the most.

[Ink] 22:25:15
We've got…

[Murderbot] 22:25:21
Recent version of Murderbot?

[GM] 22:25:23
This is a test run. They fully expect this mission will fail, and that.

[Murderbot] 22:25:27
Everybody to die, yeah. Wonderful.

[GM] 22:25:28
Everybody's gonna die, but, uh, you know… If they succeed, then okay.

[GM] 22:25:35
That's good.

[Ink] 22:25:35
But, um, what about some…

[Murderbot] 22:25:36
Called myself suicide bot.

[Ink] 22:25:41
So we, uh, maybe some equipment to analyze drugs, I guess, would be one thing?

[GM] 22:25:46
Um… so… That's fine. Um…

[Ink] 22:25:47
You might want…

[GM] 22:25:53
I will… did I share the player's handbook with you guys?

[Carnoc] 22:25:57
Yeah…

[Murderbot] 22:25:57
So, the old one, the first one?

[GM] 22:25:58
Yeah. Yeah. So, if you take a look at, um, page 10.

[Dex] 22:25:58
Yeah.

[GM] 22:26:04
And that… In that book. So, on the front cover, if you ever need to see what a weapon does, it's like on the front cover, uh, but…

[GM] 22:26:11
Page 10 has, like, an equipment list. It goes on to page 11.

[GM] 22:26:15
Um… There are some things on here that they're…

[GM] 22:26:20
Not gonna give you, because they're extremely expensive. So… but anything under, like, 10,000, they'd probably be willing to provide.

[GM] 22:26:32
Which means no jetpack. No… no XLord, or…

[GM] 22:26:38
No organic pet.

[GM] 22:26:43
But otherwise, I think probably everything else.

[Carnoc] 22:26:50
I guess I'd want, like, Stimpak and some mags for my guns.

[Zeke] 22:26:56
Definitely we could use some stimpact.

[Ink] 22:26:58
Yeah, impact some…

[GM] 22:27:01
Okay. Um, here maybe we'll try implementing the, um… what I've got planned for my…

[GM] 22:27:10
Um… uh… game, which is that…

[GM] 22:27:16
So, you can carry on your person, effectively. Like, two large objects?

[GM] 22:27:24
Um, two medium objects. And then, um, I think it's, like, 4 small objects?

[GM] 22:27:31
So a small object would be, like, a stim pack, or a grenade.

[GM] 22:27:36
Um, medium objects would be, like. Um.

[GM] 22:27:42
Probably, like, an SMG or a pistol, um… have… a large object would be, like, a pulse rifle, or, like, um…

[GM] 22:27:53
The, uh, type of rifle that… What's that? Anti-material rifle? That would be a large object.

[GM] 22:28:00
So, probably, you know. They're not gonna provide you with 100 Stimpaks or anything. We'll say 10K worth of materials for each of you.

[GM] 22:28:11
That's what they're willing to provide.

[Ink] 22:28:15
We're… I don't see stimpacts in the first two pages, they're somewhere else.

[GM] 22:28:18
Equipment, page 11, um, STEMPAC is 1 kilocredit each.

[Carnoc] 22:28:19
But on the second page of the equipment.

[Ink] 22:28:25
So, you know, we'd be able to buy 10 of those if we spent all our individual money on Sympaks.

[GM] 22:28:30
Yeah, yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:28:36
What kind of budget does Murderbock get?

[GM] 22:28:41
Um… I don't know. Probably the same.

[Ink] 22:28:44
I definitely want some paracord. Rope.

[Murderbot] 22:28:48
I mean…

[Ink] 22:28:56
We still have our, uh, hazard suits.

[GM] 22:28:59
Uh, they'll provide you with, um… back suits.

[GM] 22:29:04
They don't expect that there will be, uh… Radiation.

[Ink] 22:29:06
Radiation stuff. Oh, those are 10 till 10 kilocredits by themselves, okay.

[GM] 22:29:14
Yeah, but they're gonna provide those regardless, like, in case your ship were to break down.

[GM] 22:29:19
En route, they'd want you to be able to fix it.

[GM] 22:29:22
So you need a Vaxxer to be able to get out into that.

[GM] 22:29:25
Space.

[Ink] 22:29:26
Right. What would be a discrete. Weapon to… are we not expected to carry out the, uh, assassination? You said we would hire assassins?

[GM] 22:29:37
Um, you can… you can… if you can, like. Find the leadership, or whoever's making this drug and kill them.

[GM] 22:29:44
They want you to do that, but it's not necessarily… they don't expect you to.

[GM] 22:29:49
Be able to do that.

[Ink] 22:29:59
The unarmed weapon is free.

[Dex] 22:30:02
Do we know what this drug is called?

[GM] 22:30:05
Yeah. It's called Sickorax. Or cycle racks? I'll spell it for you.

[Ink] 22:30:09
Cycrax. Bitecore cracks.

[GM] 22:30:12
Um… It is spelled…

[GM] 22:30:21
Syco. R-a-x.

[GM] 22:30:25
So, Sycorex or Cycorex…

[Ink] 22:30:38
Stone by stone.

[Carnoc] 22:30:41
How many small things did he say we kick here? Oh, four.

[GM] 22:30:44
Uh, 4, if you're able to… if you're carrying… too large and too medium. You can carry a little bit more if you're, like.

[GM] 22:30:50
Not carrying medium. Like, a medium item is worth, like, too small.

[Carnoc] 22:30:53
Okay.

[GM] 22:30:54
Items. And then 2 medium items is worth one.

[GM] 22:30:59
Large item. So, in total.

[Murderbot] 22:31:03
Where are the charges?

[GM] 22:31:05
For the size of these things, they're not… this… I'm making this up, so you kind of just have to imagine, like… what the relative size of these things are.

[Murderbot] 22:31:08
Oh, oh.

[GM] 22:31:12
Um, if you're ever… don't know, you can always ask me, but… Um, so in total, if you were to give up, like, carrying any medium or large objects, then you would.

[GM] 22:31:20
Be able to carry, uh, 2, 4… 8.

[GM] 22:31:28
And there… for… 12… 16 small objects.

[Ink] 22:31:36
So we can't have an organic pet, but we can have a synthetic pet if two of us combined our money together.

[GM] 22:31:41
Yeah, sure.

[GM] 22:31:52
You always have to wonder, was it programmed to love you, or does it actually love you?

[Ink] 22:31:59
I can't tell the difference, does it really matter?

[GM] 22:32:02
That's how my partner feels about our dog.

[Murderbot] 22:32:05
Oh my god.

[Ink] 22:32:09
Who has computers? Skills?

[Dex] 22:32:12
So with the… this auto-med thing?

[Dex] 22:32:19
Would that help us, like… say we have to end up in a situation where we have to, like, take some cigarettes or whatever, would that nullify the effects, or…?

[GM] 22:32:33
Yeah. Yeah. And there's 5 uses there with that.

[Dex] 22:32:34
I don't know, it seems like a useful thing to have.

[Dex] 22:32:42
How, like, how visible is a salvage drone? Like, we couldn't, like, use it for… surveillance purposes, right? It'd be very obvious.

[GM] 22:32:51
Yeah, this thing's bigger than, like, a normal drone. Um…

[GM] 22:32:59
Because it can actually carry some… yeah, it can carry, like, almost 50 pounds. It's like… Actually, more than 50 pounds, but yeah.

[Dex] 22:33:03
Oh, okay, wow, yeah.

[GM] 22:33:08
So, it's a large… it's like, uh, more like a military grade.

[Ink] 22:33:08
Oh, goodbye one.

[GM] 22:33:13
Drone, you know, where it's like…

[GM] 22:33:18
Flies pretty fast. Totally, you know…

[GM] 22:33:24
Probably pretty noticeable.

[Ink] 22:33:31
What did you find, Dex, that was gonna allow you to take the drug and maybe not have effect, but… Say again?

[Dex] 22:33:36
The auto bed. The AutoMed, it's, like, a thing.

[Ink] 22:33:39
Out of it.

[Ink] 22:33:48
Then you get 5 uses, you said, oh, times 5, okay, cool.

[Ink] 22:33:54
GM, you said we get STEMPACs without. Having to spend our money?

[GM] 22:33:58
No, Stimpacts are part of your money you're spending. Yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 22:34:01
Part of our 10,000, right? Okay.

[Ink] 22:34:12
How do we…

[Dex] 22:34:13
I feel like an emergency beacon's not really gonna help us.

[Zeke] 22:34:18
For now.

[Ink] 22:34:19
Seems like a computer would be nice. If somebody could use it.

[GM] 22:34:27
Only if someone had computers.

[Ink] 22:34:28
Does anybody have computer skills? Well, it…

[Dex] 22:34:30
No.

[Zeke] 22:34:30
You need skills to use a computer?

[Murderbot] 22:34:31
I do!

[Carnoc] 22:34:34
Portable computer terminal.

[Ink] 22:34:35
Murderbot has computer skill, right? Okay. I'll… I'll throw in…

[Murderbot] 22:34:38
I have computer skills, yep. I'll tell you all the skills I have. I have linguistics, first aid, computers, mechanical repair, and mathematics.

[Zeke] 22:34:48
You just… he's just bragging.

[GM] 22:34:50
He's doing the C-3PO thing.

[Murderbot] 22:34:53
I have simply listing all the different skills I possess. For your benefit.

[Zeke] 22:34:53
Yeah.

[GM] 22:35:05
Man, you guys would be so sad when the version 2 dies as well.

[Ink] 22:35:06
Um…

[Zeke] 22:35:10
Terrible.

[Ink] 22:35:12
Shoot a med scanner, that's pretty expensive. That would probably test if somebody has… is on the drugs, right?

[Ink] 22:35:18
What do we need? What information about the drugs are we supposed to find, other than how it's being produced, or where it's being produced?

[GM] 22:35:24
Um, I mean, nothing more about that, uh, more so about, like.

[Ink] 22:35:29
Gotcha.

[GM] 22:35:29
Who's in charge and trying to kill them.

[Murderbot] 22:35:33
Uh, you guys also… I say you guys pick my equipment, too, because… I have no…

[GM] 22:35:42
You're not getting an allowance. You're just there to… Yeah.

[Ink] 22:35:44
Oh, he doesn't get one? Okay, so we have to buy the computer for him.

[Ink] 22:35:48
Okay. Well, I'll throw in for…

[Murderbot] 22:35:49
I can carry whatever you want me to carry, and uh… stuff that you guys don't want to carry, but…

[Ink] 22:35:58
Shoot, I need, like, a…

[Murderbot] 22:35:59
I don't get an allowance, I guess. I guess I just… Like I said, I just… I'll list some… I'll list all my skills, and then you guys pick.

[Ink] 22:36:08
Hey, Greg. Oh, thank you. And it's food delivery now.

[Ink] 22:36:13
Well, you know, there was a third lady, and she was gonna come up here, but… Maybe not right away.

[Dex] 22:36:16
So we're just… I should change Heather to DeVac suit, you said.

[GM] 22:36:21
Um, you can keep your hazard suit if it's not been, uh, destroyed.

[Dex] 22:36:26
Okay.

[Ink] 22:36:27
He said I got a new glove, right?

[GM] 22:36:29
Yeah, you got a new glove.

[Murderbot] 22:36:33
Alright, so we don't have any hazard… we don't… GM, we don't have a hazard suit anymore?

[Dex] 22:36:33
This… what we say a spanner is a media might, America?

[GM] 22:36:36
What's that, Dex? If you're ha-.

[GM] 22:36:42
Your motorbot does not have a hazard… hazard suit, but it does have a vac suit.

[Murderbot] 22:36:46
Yes. Back seat.

[GM] 22:36:49
Yeah. Dex, what were you asking?

[Dex] 22:36:52
What I call a span or a medium item?

[GM] 22:36:55
Uh, actually, Spanish probably is a small item. Well, no, no, no, well, it depends on how big you want it to be, like, because there are rather…

[Dex] 22:37:03
Well, I was using it like a crowbar, so I feel like it's a medium item.

[GM] 22:37:05
Yeah, then I would go with medium.

[Murderbot] 22:37:11
V-a-x suit, or VA… species.

[GM] 22:37:13
Like, vacuum suit. It's like, so you can survive out in vacuum.

[Murderbot] 22:37:15
Oh, okay. Gotcha.

[GM] 22:37:35
Hmm. Somehow, I don't feel like PKU.

[GM] 22:37:41
Did your intelligence right. Because you have a 44.

[Murderbot] 22:37:44
Why? What happened? Out of?

[GM] 22:37:49
Well, you roll 2d10 plus 25 for each stat, right? But then, but then when you're an Android, you had plus 20 to that.

[Murderbot] 22:37:54
Uh-huh.

[Murderbot] 22:37:59
Okay.

[GM] 22:38:00
So, if I subtract 20 from intellect. You somehow got a negative 1 on your rolls.

[Murderbot] 22:38:09
I don't know what I did.

[GM] 22:38:11
I'm gonna… I'm gonna guess that you rolled a 44. And then you're… you didn't… forgot to add your plus 20 to that.

[Ink] 22:38:18
Ah, you've been so much smarter last time.

[Murderbot] 22:38:18
I thought it automatically did it. Oh.

[GM] 22:38:21
Uh, alternatively, I guess maybe you could have… You also do have to apply minus 10 to 1 stat, which might be…

[Murderbot] 22:38:28
Oh, that's what I did. Yeah, I took… I added the 20 and then minus 10 or something like that.

[GM] 22:38:28
I guess that maybe is… oh, okay, so you…

[GM] 22:38:34
Gotcha. So you rolled… You rolled a 34 at a 20 to it, and then subtracted 10 from it. Okay.

[Murderbot] 22:38:35
I remember, I… yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:38:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I didn't do it for the… because none of my other skills are in the 20s, right? So…

[GM] 22:38:41
That makes sense.

[Ink] 22:38:44
That's interesting.

[Murderbot] 22:38:50
Like… Yeah.

[GM] 22:38:50
Right. Then everything else seems fine there, but… Then you're, uh, fear save seems too low.

[Murderbot] 22:38:58
Here, that's 62. Yeah, it messed up because these bonuses, it had something to do with, you know, we went into the attributes and abilities, and like.

[GM] 22:39:00
Yeah, because 2D…

[GM] 22:39:10
That's true, they're gonna… they're gonna crank that up a little bit. I think they're gonna go take that up to… Let's see… they'll crank it up to…

[Murderbot] 22:39:11
They wanted… you remember we had, like, modifiers or something like that? We couldn't get it right until… I don't know how I landed on 52, but…

[Murderbot] 22:39:22
I mean, you know… The company can always change the settings on MurderBot version 2, right?

[Murderbot] 22:39:31
Yay! Yay! Vernabot version 2! It's actually version 2.

[Zeke] 22:39:37
Got the BIOS upgrade.

[GM] 22:39:39
Add a ton to that. 72.

[Murderbot] 22:39:41
Woohoo! You want me to do it?

[Dex] 22:39:43
The worst suits come with short-range comps, or do we need to do that?

[GM] 22:39:45
Yeah, you do it. Uh, vacuits have… if you go to page.

[Murderbot] 22:39:48
I did it.

[GM] 22:39:54
Where are you? Uh, 14, it shows you all the different armor types and what.

[GM] 22:40:00
What's a… in them? Um, but… a brief overview. Vacsuits have… Two headlamps, a short-range comms, and 12 hours of oxygen supply.

[GM] 22:40:11
Um, and provide 3 armor points. However, you are disadvantaged on speed checks while you wear it, because it's heavy.

[Dex] 22:40:12
Okay.

[Murderbot] 22:40:23
Does Murderbot get a pulse rifle or an SMG, or no?

[Murderbot] 22:40:27
None of the above. Okay.

[GM] 22:40:30
None of the above. You're not really there… you're not there as a combat assistant. They're not expecting you to have to fight.

[Murderbot] 22:40:41
Do I still have a pen knife?

[GM] 22:40:43
Sure. Sure. That could be, like, a thing that, you know… Um, for some reason, all Murderbots of this line have been, uh… they find having a penknife on them is comforting.

[Murderbot] 22:40:50
Yeah, I…

[Murderbot] 22:40:57
I mean, I still have, like, from the stuff before, I have on my calendar is a trinket, the Apex Predator patch.

[Zeke] 22:40:58
That's like an impact.

[Murderbot] 22:41:05
70 credits. A first aid kit and a STEM pack.

[Murderbot] 22:41:09
So… I'll just keep those, whatever.

[GM] 22:41:11
That's fine. You can keep all that stuff, that's fine.

[Murderbot] 22:41:14
And then whatever else you guys want to load me up with.

[Murderbot] 22:41:18
Uh, let me know, and I'll add it to my, uh… my equipment was.

[GM] 22:41:23
Although I do think you need a new, um, patch. Or trinket.

[Murderbot] 22:41:28
Ooh, yay! I'll take a new patch one if you trinket.

[GM] 22:41:29
Rule D100. This'll be for your trinket to start.

[Murderbot] 22:41:34
E100.

[GM] 22:41:43
62. Trinket is… Patched overalls. Personalized.

[Murderbot] 22:41:50
What is that? How is that a… How is that a trinket?

[Dex] 22:41:51
What?

[GM] 22:41:52
You…

[Carnoc] 22:41:58
They're from Murderbot V1's favorite overalls.

[GM] 22:42:03
You're walking in that shiny white armor, you're walking in overalls, you look like…

[Murderbot] 22:42:09
Best overall. Oh, do I not get standard crew attire? I get… I get past overalls? Okay.

[GM] 22:42:16
I mean, it's hatched over Thompson. All right, roll another D100.

[GM] 22:42:28
85. You're… Your patch says.

[Murderbot] 22:42:29
85!

[GM] 22:42:32
It's a Paris dice with snake eyes. Snake eyes.

[Murderbot] 22:42:35
Mocha, make a…

[Murderbot] 22:42:41
I'm a gambling murder… murder bot.

[GM] 22:42:47
He's got overalls. Why is he wearing overalls? He's got no shirt.

[Murderbot] 22:42:50
I don't know. Just… just overall?

[GM] 22:42:51
He's just… he's just walking around, no shirt on. You're apparently undercover as a Teamster, is what you're looking like.

[Murderbot] 22:42:56
So, weird.

[Murderbot] 22:43:03
Do I get an accent, too?

[GM] 22:43:05
Sure, they could prom… you have linguistics, you can figure it out.

[Murderbot] 22:43:09
Yee-haw! Where did you come from? Where did you go?

[GM] 22:43:15
They do… they do want you to, like, not be known to be an android. They think that that would be helpful.

[Murderbot] 22:43:20
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:43:21
So, if you wanted to do the accent the whole time, they're good with that.

[Murderbot] 22:43:25
Well, you know, I've got some… them overalls on.

[Murderbot] 22:43:38
Oh, no, I don't want to see Murderbot with overall. In the pictures, but they're coming.

[GM] 22:43:48
Yep, he's cranking away, you can watch… you can see it in his face.

[GM] 22:43:53
Um…

[Ink] 22:43:54
Uh, did you guys listen to the MP3 that I uploaded?

[Dex] 22:43:58
No.

[Murderbot] 22:43:59
Oh…

[Ink] 22:43:59
Probably worth… We probably, yeah, somebody should just play that for everybody while we figure out our equipment.

[GM] 22:44:00
Ballad of Samsa VI.

[Dex] 22:44:18
Nobody even has cover art.

[Murderbot] 22:44:37
Where did you go? Got mad joked.

[GM] 22:44:54
Lots of crawling!

[Ink] 22:45:06
I think verse 3 is my favorite.

[Dex] 22:45:06
Generated music country.

[GM] 22:45:13
Version 2 has a song playing in his brain all the time.

[Murderbot] 22:45:18
Oh, no.

[Ink] 22:45:22
I should have done a harmonica, because that's what Inks, uh… additional thing is, that's what I'm about to redo the song real quick.

[GM] 22:45:29
I'm gonna have to redo the song real quick.

[GM] 22:45:36
Um, you can keep picking gear, um… But they're… they're more or less, uh.

[GM] 22:45:43
The next bit is going to be just sending you on your way.

[GM] 22:45:49
Um, so basically, uh… They put you… they send you off in the same ship.

[GM] 22:45:56
Rinky-dinky, dark, musty… Uh, constantly shuddering from…

[GM] 22:46:01
Trying to travel, uh… through space.

[GM] 22:46:08
Pk, mute yourself.

[Murderbot] 22:46:10
Hey, this is really good!

[GM] 22:46:17
Um… So the, uh… you meet the Teamster.

[GM] 22:46:21
His name is…

[GM] 22:46:32
Sorry, I've got it written down here.

[Murderbot] 22:46:42
You know, that's scary, man.

[GM] 22:46:45
Phoenix done right. Phoenix Dunright is the Teamster that…

[GM] 22:46:50
This is gonna get you onto Prospero's dream. Um…

[GM] 22:46:57
He said it, you know, he tells you… Yeah, we're gonna be, uh, traveling… for a while, so I'm gonna punch in some coordinates. It won't be the exact position, but…

[GM] 22:47:05
It'll give us enough time that, um, once we wake up from cryo sleep.

[GM] 22:47:09
That'll be about another week in transit, uh, so the cryo-seat can wear off before we get to.

[GM] 22:47:14
Close to where it's supposed to be.

[Ink] 22:47:18
What's Phoenix look like?

[GM] 22:47:20
Um… he looks like a mechanic. Uh, he's got, like, a… sort of almost a constant, um, sort of dirt cloud around him. He's like, he's like, he's.

[GM] 22:47:34
Actually, like, have a dirt cloud, but, like, you know, you can kind of tell, like, his skin's oily and, um, kind of grimy, um…

[GM] 22:47:47
Long… greasy hair.

[GM] 22:47:52
Uh… You can tell, sort of, like, there's a permanent crinkle in his hair where he, like, kind of ties it up into a ponytail.

[GM] 22:48:03
Um, so yeah, you guys… He's like, just so you know, I'm not gonna try and fund any business while we're in cryo sleep, I'll go into cryo sleep first. I'll program the computer to get us to.

[GM] 22:48:15
Close to where we're supposed to be, um… And then, uh, I'll go into cryosleep, and you guys can come in after.

[Ink] 22:48:22
We don't have moss, right?

[GM] 22:48:24
Nomas.

[Murderbot] 22:48:27
No, last month.

[Dex] 22:48:30
Yeah.

[GM] 22:48:30
No mosque. Moss? No mas?

[Murderbot] 22:48:35
Norma

[GM] 22:48:37
Um… So, Phoenix goes and he programs the ship.

[GM] 22:48:44
It goes… strips down into his undies, and then climbs into the cryo bed.

[GM] 22:48:48
It says, see you in a few months! Like, closes the chamber.

[GM] 22:48:53
Uh, it doesn't take long before he falls asleep.

[Ink] 22:49:01
But we still need him because he only got us so close.

[GM] 22:49:05
Yeah. I mean, you could sabotage this cryo sleep chamber and then fly off with this terrible ship.

[GM] 22:49:14
And a permanently wounded Dex.

[GM] 22:49:23
Are you guys happen to cryosleep as well? Okay.

[Ink] 22:49:25
That sounds good. But do we get to convert our stress to anything?

[Carnoc] 22:49:27
Yeah.

[GM] 22:49:32
Not yet, you haven't taken shore leave.

[Ink] 22:49:34
Oh, okay. When there's no hurry, right? So we could have taken short lead before?

[GM] 22:49:38
There was no short leave to be had on the company ship.

[Ink] 22:49:41
Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 22:49:42
It's… it's not fun. You have to do… Shore Leave is, like.

[GM] 22:49:46
You gotta blow off some steam. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

[Ink] 22:49:48
Okay. So let's take the coordinates and change them, and let's go do Shoreleaf real quick while he's…

[Ink] 22:49:55
Great.

[GM] 22:49:55
No, the Teamstra guy tells you before he… climbs into the cryo sheep chamber. He's like, you're gonna enjoy Prospero's dream.

[Zeke] 22:49:55
Interesting to make more isolated.

[GM] 22:50:02
And he goes to sleep.

[Ink] 22:50:02
Oh, okay.

[Dex] 22:50:02
With… what was… what was the thing with Wicked Heal Up to 14 stress by converting it then? That was…

[Carnoc] 22:50:09
When we do, short leave.

[GM] 22:50:09
That's… that's when you do short leave, yeah.

[Dex] 22:50:12
Okay. So at the Class X part, you cannot do Charlotte.

[Ink] 22:50:14
Like me.

[GM] 22:50:17
At the what? You were not at a class export.

[Dex] 22:50:18
At the class export we were at, we cannot do shortly.

[Dex] 22:50:24
Oh, okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:50:24
The thing that you were on was, like, company ship. It's like… Um, there's no drinking, smoking's allowed.

[GM] 22:50:31
There's, you know, they actually have pretty strict regulations on, like, intercroup, uh, personal relationships and shit, like.

[GM] 22:50:38
It's a real downer being… it's like going to work. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:50:40
No fluid… no fluid transfers.

[GM] 22:50:46
Imagine you're stuck at work all day long. Your sleep's monitored, uh, you know, like, to tell you when to get up.

[Murderbot] 22:50:49
Oh my god.

[GM] 22:50:55
It's… it's not… it's not… it's not fun. Um…

[GM] 22:51:02
Anyways, so you guys climb into cryo sleep chambers. Um, and program them to…

[GM] 22:51:09
Like, basically end the cycle once you arrive at your destination, or if some… Alright, you do yours, like, what, 10 minutes before? How much more before you want?

[Ink] 22:51:13
10 minutes before the other teamster wakes up.

[Ink] 22:51:21
Um, give me 30 minutes, just…

[GM] 22:51:23
30 minutes beforehand. Okay. Um…

[GM] 22:51:29
We'll say that, like, your previous cryosleep. Sickness had worn off from the.

[GM] 22:51:33
Previous round, so that, um… Does that compound?

[Ink] 22:51:36
Not compounding. It's just… it's just like a hangover. You just keep drinking, it doesn't get worse.

[Dex] 22:51:37
Don't worry, you can earn a new one.

[GM] 22:51:39
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It just continues.

[Ink] 22:51:47
No.

[GM] 22:51:48
Um, great. You go to sleep, and then you wake up.

[GM] 22:51:54
Feels like no time has passed at all. Um, climb out your cryo sleep chamber, uh.

[GM] 22:52:01
Ink's goes off 30 minutes before. The… the Teamsters… Um, everyone who wakes up.

[GM] 22:52:08
Make a body save.

[GM] 22:52:24
Oh, boy. Everybody's feeling pretty sick from cryosleep.

[Murderbot] 22:52:31
Ah, son of a! Barely.

[GM] 22:52:35
Um, Zeke, the, uh, the defrag… Um, while you're… while you're in cryo sleep.

[GM] 22:52:42
Um, you have odd dreams of… being, um, Hinton at times, and then not hinting, um…

[GM] 22:52:50
And… as the dreamscape sort of, like, you know, because time is sort of…

[GM] 22:52:56
An illusion in your dreamscape. Um, the moments of Hinton.

[GM] 22:53:01
Appearing and not appearing, uh, lessons. Uh, to the point where, like.

[GM] 22:53:06
When you wake up from cryosleep, you're… you don't feel like… the same sort of effects you were having after the cognitive defrag, so the…

[GM] 22:53:14
The effects have worn off effectively.

[GM] 22:53:20
Um, however, you're racks with cryo-sickness. If you feel like you're gonna vomit and shit yourself all the time.

[GM] 22:53:29
Yeah. Um… Don't worry, that's why they put the little bucket next to each cryo chamber.

[GM] 22:53:36
For you to vomit into as soon as you wake up.

[Zeke] 22:53:38
Problem solved. Company paid for a bucket.

[GM] 22:53:39
Yeah. Hey, this real nice bucket. It's got… it's got your name embossed on it.

[GM] 22:53:46
Yeah. Um… All right.

[Dex] 22:53:50
If you don't return it, they'll charge you.

[GM] 22:53:52
You see the Teamster… like, his… he's, like, in full sleep, but his eyes are kind of, like, darting back and forth like he's dreaming. Um…

[GM] 22:54:01
Underneath his eyelids. Was there something… I was just gonna say, is there something you guys wanted to do?

[Zeke] 22:54:04
Ink, can you make… sorry, go ahead. I wanted Ink to make me an AI image of…

[Zeke] 22:54:10
Zeke puking into a company bucket with my name embossed on it.

[Ink] 22:54:15
Yeah.

[Dex] 22:54:26
We're gonna, like, all stand around and… grip later while he wakes up.

[GM] 22:54:32
You're all gonna put your faces on the… on the glass, and just like…

[Ink] 22:54:36
We're gonna talk about hide, so he thinks we left.

[Dex] 22:54:43
It'll probably smell the vomit and realize we're still here.

[Ink] 22:54:47
Let's smear, like, blood and stuff all over the walls. Really freak him out.

[GM] 22:54:54
If this horse shit's gonna happen to you, you're gonna make it happen to him, too.

[GM] 22:54:59
He's gonna become one of the team. The only way that happens is if you see someone transform into a carc right before your eyes.

[GM] 22:55:10
Um… Okay, I'm gonna assume that… not much is, uh…

[GM] 22:55:15
Not much is going down.

[Dex] 22:55:18
So, is… gang is with us, because Ben's gonna play Yang, or…?

[GM] 22:55:23
Uh, yeah, we'll assume that there's one more additional… actually, no, we don't necessarily have to. Ben commit… well… There may or may not be. At this moment, it's undetermined.

[Dex] 22:55:30
Okay. Because he, like, he might find his own way on the prosperous Dream, or…

[GM] 22:55:36
Yeah, he might be a current resident of Prospero's Dream. Because, spoiler alert, you guys are gonna get there.

[GM] 22:55:43
Unless you murder this guy while he's sleeping.

[Dex] 22:55:46
I mean, we don't really have a reason to do that.

[GM] 22:55:49
I don't know, you guys could take this campaign in a wildly different place.

[GM] 22:55:54
Um… The only one that can answer that is Karnock.

[Murderbot] 22:55:54
Would you like me to kill this person?

[GM] 22:56:02
Yes. Well…

[Ink] 22:56:03
We are supposed to eventually kill him, right?

[Dex] 22:56:06
I mean, he's 6… the company replica suggested that we might want to, but…

[Murderbot] 22:56:09
Kill or incapacitate? Or capture?

[GM] 22:56:12
You might want to dispose of him, I think it's what they said.

[Dex] 22:56:13
But, like, he's… But we wouldn't consider him to be a part of the leadership of Prospero's Dream, right? Like, it's inconvenient that he knows who we are.

[Murderbot] 22:56:17
Oh, dispose, not even, like, bring to justice.

[GM] 22:56:21
No, no, no, no. They want you to… He is the… yeah, he's a risk factor in terms of…

[GM] 22:56:27
Hiding your, uh… hiding your identities.

[Murderbot] 22:56:34
Yeah, that doesn't look suspicious that this guy showed up, but… Prosper.

[Carnoc] 22:56:39
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 22:56:46
What is this guy doing here? Why has he got overalls on with a patch?

[Murderbot] 22:56:53
With dice embroidered in his overall.

[GM] 22:56:57
Okay, seeing no one's murdering him while he's sleeping, uh… You're…

[Dex] 22:57:00
No, we… we should not repeat.

[Carnoc] 22:57:01
No. No. No murder, but…

[Murderbot] 22:57:03
Parnock, do you want me to murder him?

[Carnoc] 22:57:08
The murdering will come later.

[GM] 22:57:11
He's sure of it. He's sure of it. Um, so he wakes up from cryo sleep.

[Murderbot] 22:57:14
Boy.

[Dex] 22:57:15
Write that.

[GM] 22:57:19
How does he feel?

[GM] 22:57:24
Bad. He pukes and shits at the same time, it's awful.

[GM] 22:57:29
Uh, he's… he's facing the bucket, and then he's gotta immediately turn around.

[GM] 22:57:36
Doing a Daniel Papa. Um, alright.

[Ink] 22:57:41
You witnessed that?

[Murderbot] 22:57:42
General Papa!

[GM] 22:57:46
I don't know if you guys remember that conversation, I don't know if everybody was there or not, but I think I caught Steve and Daniel Papa talking about, like, that.

[GM] 22:57:55
I mean, Steve was… Steve was inquiring, and Dana Pop was like, you've never shit and puked at the same time?

[GM] 22:58:08
Alright, um… He says, oh, God, I hate cryo-sickness.

[GM] 22:58:15
But luckily, we'll have some time to rest up before we get to Prospero's dream.

[GM] 22:58:21
Um… I gotta punch in some new coordinates, but… They went up for a game of Parcheesi?

[GM] 22:58:29
Some… some blackjack, maybe? Yeah, it's got stuff you want to bet?

[Murderbot] 22:58:34
How about… Well, it's a day.

[Ink] 22:58:37
Does he have any good stuff?

[GM] 22:58:39
He's got nothing. Look at his picture! He's got a spanner, though.

[Ink] 22:58:45
Who knows? I don't know how he got that far.

[Carnoc] 22:58:48
Yeah. Should take away his spanner.

[GM] 22:58:54
Our neck just yanks it out of his hand and is like, no weapons for you.

[GM] 22:59:00
Um… These guys spend a week getting to know him. He's a pretty nice guy.

[GM] 22:59:06
Tells really good jokes. He's particularly fond of, like, dad jokes.

[GM] 22:59:09
He's like, you know… He's like, mama tomato, papa Tomato, baby tomato walking down the street.

[GM] 22:59:16
Baby tomato starts lagging behind. Papa Tomoyo goes… walks back there and smashes Baby Tomato.

[GM] 22:59:22
It says, catch up.

[Murderbot] 22:59:25
Oh, boy.

[GM] 22:59:28
He enjoys it. He likes dad jokes. Um…

[GM] 22:59:35
Alright, uh… Do you also, at times when the ship seems like it's having a nervous breakdown, he, like…

[GM] 22:59:42
You know, fixes it. It seems handy.

[Ink] 22:59:46
Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:59:47
Um, yeah. He's like, man… This is why I left the company so many years ago. Like, they don't…

[GM] 22:59:54
There's… all of us are expendable. You know, they just… all of us are expendable.

[GM] 23:00:00
We're just, like, the machines that they build. Just little cogs in the wheel, man.

[Carnoc] 23:00:07
We'll, uh… Why are you working for the company again with us now?

[GM] 23:00:07
But you guys… oh, what? Oh, because they threatened to murder me.

[Ink] 23:00:12
You get caught.

[GM] 23:00:15
Yeah. They're using, quote-unquote, advanced torch… or interrogation methods on me.

[Carnoc] 23:00:15
Yeah.

[GM] 23:00:23
Um… I'm not even sure my mates are alive or not.

[GM] 23:00:27
They quickly separated us when they caught us.

[Carnoc] 23:00:30
Yeah. What are you gonna do after the mission?

[GM] 23:00:35
Well, I'm not… once I get you to Prospero's Dream, I'm saying adios, guys. I'm back to living the dream.

[GM] 23:00:40
But, yeah, yeah.

[Carnoc] 23:00:42
You're not gonna… Like, go rescue the rest of your crew.

[GM] 23:00:46
Um… I mean, I love those guys.

[GM] 23:00:50
But I know if they were in my position, they would not try and go back and rescue the rest of them.

[GM] 23:00:57
The Teamsters Union that's on… on Prospero's Dream, they might have some other ideas.

[GM] 23:01:05
Teamsters Local 32819. Oh.

[GM] 23:01:13
We don't have any cool slogans or anything, but, you know… there's a… there's a calendar they put out every year that has jokes in it. I like that calendar.

[GM] 23:01:26
Yep, just gonna go back to… to run in Sycorax. It's the life, man.

[GM] 23:01:34
Oh. And… uh, try not to be too shocked when you start seeing everybody on… on Prospero's Dream.

[Carnoc] 23:01:42
What is that?

[GM] 23:01:43
Try to play cool. Um, you know how, uh… when you're working for the company, they highly, uh.

[GM] 23:01:50
Dissuade people from getting any kind of cyber modification. Um, well, Prospero's Dream is…

[GM] 23:01:58
You know, it's, uh, it's pro… pro everything the company prohibits.

[GM] 23:02:03
Cybermods everywhere. You're gonna see people with, like. Camera eyeballs, and… like, jet… jet packs built into their backs, and…

[Ink] 23:02:08
Cool.

[GM] 23:02:13
All kinds of shit. Um, no, I was saving up for some, though.

[Carnoc] 23:02:15
Do you have any mods? Cyber mods?

[GM] 23:02:20
So we got busted. Look at me. Do I look like my only cyber mob would be greasy?

[GM] 23:02:29
It's just be, like, greasy skin, greasy hair.

[Murderbot] 23:02:33
That's so funny, haha!

[GM] 23:02:40
Um, you better tell your bot to start acting normal, man, that… People pick up that there's an Android, like, they're gonna start to wonder. I mean.

[GM] 23:02:49
You're gonna… you're gonna think that everybody on this place is an Android with how much… cyber modification there is, but, like… He'll give away that you guys are with the company if you don't… if he's not playing it, cool.

[Murderbot] 23:03:02
Would you like to play a game?

[Carnoc] 23:03:05
Uh, vertebra, but you gotta act normal. Then you're a cyber mod.

[Carnoc] 23:03:09
Punk. I don't know.

[Murderbot] 23:03:09
Okay.

[Zeke] 23:03:18
Nice! It's, like, glowing. That's a nice bucket.

[Murderbot] 23:03:18
Oh my god!

[Ink] 23:03:23
The first bucket sucked here, I'll give you… I'll share what the first bucket looked like.

[GM] 23:03:23
Oh, God!

[Ink] 23:03:29
I was like, nah, that one's not good if the company can do better than that.

[GM] 23:03:30
Man…

[Zeke] 23:03:34
Oh, yeah. I think they might have given me that one, but…

[Ink] 23:03:34
Yep.

[GM] 23:03:37
No, they definitely give him that one.

[Zeke] 23:03:39
I like the top one.

[GM] 23:03:43
Um… He programs in the rest of the coordinates, um…

[GM] 23:03:51
And a week passes. As you… as you get…

[GM] 23:03:56
The indicator, um… that you're getting close, uh, is that an alarm… he sets it like an alarm, and uh…

[GM] 23:04:05
He, uh… runs up the computer, he punches in a code or something, he's like, okay.

[GM] 23:04:11
Um, we're here. So, prepare yourselves, uh… Remember your story.

[Carnoc] 23:04:18
What's our story?

[GM] 23:04:20
I thought the company gave you a backstory. Don't you have that… didn't they give you something?

[Ink] 23:04:28
Yeah, we're, uh, we're, like, disenfranchised with the company, we're… you know, tired of them shitting on us, so… We're looking to make a break.

[GM] 23:04:36
Yeah, they'll be pretty believable. Uh, did you… did you figure out a story for how we got the fuck out of there, though?

[Ink] 23:04:44
Was that in that manila folder?

[GM] 23:04:46
You open up the middle of a folder, it's like… your contracts, but, like… Um, that's pretty much it.

[Ink] 23:04:54
I gotcha. Um, the murder bot.

[Carnoc] 23:04:56
You should probably hide our… hide our contracts.

[Dex] 23:04:56
Did we steal this ship? I mean, it seems like the kind of thing that should self-destruct after we read it.

[Ink] 23:05:06
I said, MurderBot eat them.

[Dex] 23:05:07
Sounds good. Maybe with some ketchup.

[Ink] 23:05:12
That's right.

[GM] 23:05:21
Um… So, he… he, like…

[GM] 23:05:27
Well, you guys, you guys take some time. Prepare whatever story you want. Um, he's like, we'll be docking…

[GM] 23:05:33
Uh, I've sent… to get clearance, um… for the dock.

[GM] 23:05:39
Uh… And then, you know, she reports back sometime later that you guys, uh, like, this is not instantaneous, it takes, actually, some time for the transmission to go through and return, so…

[GM] 23:05:52
Um, probably, like, an hour. Um…

[GM] 23:05:58
It's like, yeah, which should only be a day or two now before we're there.

[GM] 23:06:01
But we've got clearance to dock.

[Ink] 23:06:05
Alright, so I say you want the story to go as close to real as possible, right? So we just got off the mission, totally, you know.

[Ink] 23:06:12
Messed up, Zeke got his brain messed up, all these different things.

[Ink] 23:06:15
They were gonna send us out, uh, they gave us a little bit of time afterwards.

[Ink] 23:06:19
And we're supposed to go get another assignment, and we just are not going to show up for that other assignment.

[Dex] 23:06:25
Yeah, so we just stole the ship, basically. Instead of going on the mission.

[Ink] 23:06:28
Soulship. They're expecting us somewhere else, and we ain't showing. But we got… we have, like, a year to get there, so…

[GM] 23:06:32
And Phoenix.

[Ink] 23:06:34
Where they won't expect us for a while. It was, like, some off… you know, some… we need some distant planet. Murderbot, what's the planet?

[Ink] 23:06:42
A year away. The other direction.

[Murderbot] 23:06:48
Was that…?

[Dex] 23:06:50
Don't you have a… don't you have an electric map inside that head somewhere?

[Ink] 23:06:51
Was he hibernating?

[Murderbot] 23:06:54
Sorry, I, I was, uh… I was playing… playing it cool.

[Murderbot] 23:07:00
Like, I'm supposed to be, uh, normal.

[Ink] 23:07:04
I just need to… I just need to plan it a thousand parsecs the opposite direction.

[Murderbot] 23:07:05
What are we doing now? Planet, 1,000 parts, that's the opposite direction, the planet would be called…

[Murderbot] 23:07:15
Hi, Laura!

[GM] 23:07:19
How many A's and I's is in that?

[Murderbot] 23:07:21
Yeah, I, uh. Kylorax.

[Ink] 23:07:24
I told ChatGPT to make it… to make an image of… of Murderbot eating the paper, and it said it wouldn't do that, because this is a non-food object. I said Murderbot's a robot that shreds things with his mouth, and then it accepted the promise.

[Dex] 23:07:26
I think he's broken.

[Murderbot] 23:07:40
Tylorax!

[Ink] 23:07:44
Alright.

[GM] 23:07:44
Um, then, uh, Phoenix asks, like, what's the story for… him, like, why is he here with others, crew, or the…

[GM] 23:07:51
Sicorax payment.

[Ink] 23:07:54
Oh, gotcha. So, uh… let's say we picked… so we went… we picked them up on that… that space station where we were, right? We kind of busted him out.

[GM] 23:08:03
Okay.

[Ink] 23:08:05
Um.

[Ink] 23:08:10
Yeah.

[GM] 23:08:12
Okay, I mean, that might fly.

[Dex] 23:08:15
Yeah, we're looking for some way to… make some money, because we're all in debt.

[Ink] 23:08:15
How do we say we have wheels?

[Carnoc] 23:08:20
We could say we found him in, like, a escape pod, just in the middle of space.

[Carnoc] 23:08:31
And so… the company, like, destroyed its ship.

[Carnoc] 23:08:36
Uh, but he was able to get an escape pod.

[GM] 23:08:42
I'm good with that.

[Carnoc] 23:08:43
And uh… he told us about this place, and we want to be… We want to join up and run some drugs with them.

[Ink] 23:08:54
Oh yeah, it's probably best if we don't mention that he ever had contact with the, uh.

[Carnoc] 23:08:57
Right. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:08:57
The company, I like that. So we just found him and the rest of his mates dead.

[Ink] 23:09:02
He was just floating in space.

[Carnoc] 23:09:03
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 23:09:07
Friends of drugs!

[GM] 23:09:10
All right. Um… That's the story.

[GM] 23:09:17
Um… So as you're traveling through space, you look out.

[GM] 23:09:21
One of the windows, as he tells you that you're getting close, and you see, um, the station, so the.

[GM] 23:09:27
The top picture is, um, sort of like a side view of the station.

[GM] 23:09:32
It's huge. Like, this… Um, the station itself probably holds, like.

[GM] 23:09:39
100 of the ship that you're on easily within its docks.

[GM] 23:09:43
Um, if you had to estimate the population of this thing.

[GM] 23:09:47
Um, it would be easily over a million people live on the station.

[GM] 23:09:51
Just based on the size of it. The picture in the bottom half is, like, a top-down sort of look… view of it.

[GM] 23:10:00
Um, so there she is, for Sparrow's Dream. Pull us into the dock.

[GM] 23:10:07
Um, and so… He navigates the ship, uh, into the docking area. There's, uh.

[GM] 23:10:15
A bit of, um… some slow maneuvering, uh, because there's ships coming in and out all the time.

[GM] 23:10:24
Um, it looks like there's… a lot of trade that goes through here.

[GM] 23:10:28
And it kind of tells you that there's not really, um… It's not all legal stuff.

[GM] 23:10:33
Um, there's obviously… the station isn't fully self-sufficient. There's, like, food being brought in, and…

[GM] 23:10:39
Other things, um… He gives you a little bit of heads up as to, like, what the reception's gonna be like, um…

[GM] 23:10:46
They do a pretty… a thorough decontamination process upon arrival.

[GM] 23:10:53
Um, which is going to mean getting… hose down, is what he says.

[GM] 23:10:59
Um… Also, they're… they're gonna…

[GM] 23:11:03
Probably do a search over the ship. Uh, for any thing that could be extremely dangerous.

[GM] 23:11:10
Uh, mostly, like, biological or chemical weapons or anything like that.

[GM] 23:11:14
Nukes, you know, whatever we might be carrying. Um…

[GM] 23:11:21
He lets you know that the ship has a manifest. That, um, has been altered, but shouldn't be traceable in its alterations, just to match exactly what's on board with you guys right now.

[GM] 23:11:34
Um. And that, uh…

[GM] 23:11:39
Don't be surprised if they don't let you take on any, uh, any heavy armaments onto the station.

[GM] 23:11:44
So he points at, um… Carnax, uh… anti-material rifle is, like.

[GM] 23:11:51
They're not gonna let you bring that on… on board. That's… that's a little too dangerous for their… their liking, but…

[GM] 23:11:57
Um, most of the other weapons you guys got locked and loaded are probably gonna be fine.

[GM] 23:12:05
Um… they'll be a little rough, but don't take it personally. They do it to everybody.

[GM] 23:12:16
Um, and so he pulls you into a dry dock. Um, this one has, like, a sealable hanger bay, so, like.

[GM] 23:12:24
It'll close, and then oxygen will refill into the space. Um, your ship's not so big.

[GM] 23:12:30
That requires to be out in the vacuum still.

[GM] 23:12:38
With ketchup. Um…

[Carnoc] 23:12:41
I'm hot sauce on the paper.

[GM] 23:12:47
Once the, uh, hangar base, uh, closed and. Oxygen's been repressurized, uh… you're able to disembark from your ship.

[GM] 23:12:59
Um… They take you to, uh, you're met by…

[GM] 23:13:04
I think it's a… it's a Q team. How many people in a queue team?

[GM] 23:13:09
25 plus 1.

[GM] 23:13:18
Four people. Four people show up. They have, um… two of them have…

[GM] 23:13:23
Uh, what looks like a… backpack with a hose attached to it, and uh… two of them have pulse rifles.

[GM] 23:13:32
Um, they tell you pretty much exactly what. Uh, Phoenix has told you, which is… Yeah. No heavy armaments.

[GM] 23:13:40
Um… they… they tell you they'll need to search the ship, but they can do that while you guys are in decontamination.

[GM] 23:13:49
Um… They suggest that you leave anything personal behind in case it gets lost in decontamination.

[GM] 23:13:56
Um. And then, uh, they're gonna check your manifest and match it.

[GM] 23:14:03
Uh, check the logs and stuff. So it lets you know that all this is gonna happen.

[GM] 23:14:10
Um… Is there anything you guys want to ask of them, or…?

[GM] 23:14:16
Are you gonna resist? Going through the decontamination process or anything?

[Ink] 23:14:20
I started taking off my clothes. Let's go.

[GM] 23:14:23
They're like, okay, hold on, buddy. We're going… we're going to the… the contamination room, so…

[GM] 23:14:32
Um… It's not a pleasant process, uh…

[GM] 23:14:37
The guys with the hoses spray you down with, uh… What do they got? They got foam guns.

[GM] 23:14:44
Uh, but the foam is, like, kind of sticky. Um, and so, they take these, like, bristly brushes and, like, scrape them over your body, and it really, like.

[GM] 23:14:54
It's a painful process. Um, it makes your skin pretty raw.

[Murderbot] 23:14:55
Ugh.

[GM] 23:14:59
Uh, afterwards. It's like as if you've got, like, a… Um, rug burn all over your body, yeah.

[Dex] 23:15:05
Through a car wash.

[GM] 23:15:09
Um… But you come out of it, um… No worse for wear, you know…

[GM] 23:15:15
Um, they hand each of you an O2 cred stick. They tell you to keep it on you at all times. It tracks your movements.

[GM] 23:15:24
Um, they ask you how much, uh. Money you want to transfer into your O2 cred stick.

[GM] 23:15:32
Uh, it's 10 credits a day.

[Ink] 23:15:42
I'll do, I guess, 300 for 30 days.

[GM] 23:15:45
Okay.

[GM] 23:15:53
Um, they tell you if you're ever found with your O2 cred stick without any, um.

[GM] 23:15:58
Money on it. Um, and it does often signal when you run out of money, so… It's only a matter of time before someone finds you with it.

[GM] 23:16:06
Uh, that you get sent down to the, uh… Doptown. You don't want to go to Doptown. It's a pretty shitty place to be.

[Ink] 23:16:16
All right, so I have… I bought 300… or I bought 30 days worth, right? So… the O2 Cred Stick.

[GM] 23:16:24
Yeah, Doptown. It's called… it's… short for deoxygenated People's Town.

[GM] 23:16:31
You can't pay for oxygen? That's where you go.

[GM] 23:16:37
And then they ask you guys individually, like, as if you're going through customs, are you carrying any laser cutters, explosives, signal jammers, contagious bioweapons, EMP tech?

[GM] 23:16:46
Um, Hole Piercing weapons, uh, or… Uh, anything else that might be extremely destructive?

[Ink] 23:16:56
Nope, I didn't. Thanks.

[Murderbot] 23:16:56
Nope.

[Carnoc] 23:16:57
I guess I would have left my grenades on the ship then.

[GM] 23:17:03
Yeah. They do tell you, like, if you are carrying that, please go place it on the ship, and do not bring it in.

[GM] 23:17:15
Um… if you would like to store any non-hole-piercing weapons, um… Not on your ship, but closer to where you're at, there are lockers available for them.

[GM] 23:17:25
Uh, the key is tagged to your fingerprint, so don't lose your fingerprints.

[GM] 23:17:32
They said that with all seriousness.

[GM] 23:17:37
Um… And then, last… last, uh, rule…

[GM] 23:17:44
Uh, do not enter unauthorized areas, particularly the choke.

[Ink] 23:17:51
Choke?

[Dex] 23:17:52
The one.

[GM] 23:17:52
Don't worry, the choke's down in Doptown, so as long as you keep payments on your, uh, O2 cred stick, you'll be alright.

[GM] 23:17:59
Uh, but the choke is, uh… Well, you don't want to go there anyways.

[Murderbot] 23:18:03
What have… what happens in the chilt?

[Zeke] 23:18:05
What is it?

[GM] 23:18:06
The choke is, uh… Let's just say that not all parts of the station are in good repair.

[GM] 23:18:14
And you go down there, you might get sick, and we don't need you bringing anything back up here.

[GM] 23:18:28
And with that, he opens up the doors to the… Uh, Prospero's dream.

[GM] 23:18:36
Um… And… I'm feeling a little tired, guys, so I… we might call it there.

[Ink] 23:18:45
Are you… are you saying Prospero's Dream? Yeah.

[GM] 23:18:48
Yeah, you want me to spell for you?

[Murderbot] 23:18:50
P-r-o-s-p-e-r-o apostrophe S.

[GM] 23:18:57
Wow. Pk's on it. You nailed it.

[Ink] 23:18:59
Thank you, Murbot.

[Carnoc] 23:19:01
Murderbot and his linguistics.

[GM] 23:19:02
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 23:19:04
I mean, it's literally how you… how you say it, prosperos.

[Dex] 23:19:04
Isn't that, like, a Shakespeare character or something?

[Ink] 23:19:09
Well, the closed caption had said Sparrow's Dream last time, and so unfortunately I created an image that says Sparrow's Dream.

[Murderbot] 23:19:10
Dream!

[Murderbot] 23:19:15
How sparrows. Like, Sparrow, as in the bird.

[Ink] 23:19:20
Yeah. So which character just said they were tired?

[GM] 23:19:27
No, GM says die.

[GM] 23:19:33
Phoenix done right. Hey, it's done right, he's… he's tired.

[Ink] 23:19:35
Phoenix done, right? Hmm.

[Ink] 23:19:40
I asked it to put a brown spot on it, and it wouldn't do that either.

[Ink] 23:34:17
Anybody want to pitch in for a cybernetic diagnostic scanner? Long-range comms and a portable computer terminal.

[Zeke] 23:34:25
I don't know what I want to buy, so a shirt.

[Murderbot] 23:34:30
I have no say in this.

[Ink] 23:34:33
You know, credit, so…

[Dex] 23:34:34
I was… I was leaning towards getting the… Automed… First aid kit, a patch kit to fix vacuits.

[Ink] 23:34:42
You know, I grabbed all those…

[Dex] 23:34:45
Um, a med scanner.

[Ink] 23:34:49
And that's… okay, I didn't grab the MedScan. Medscan is pretty expensive, okay.

[Dex] 23:34:51
Yeah, and that's my… basically my whole budget.

[Ink] 23:34:55
Okay, so yeah, you're… yeah, and then you… you did… you did really well.

[Ink] 23:34:58
So maybe I need to look. So, yeah, I grabbed… I grabbed this sort of tools, I grabbed a handful of, uh.

[Ink] 23:35:04
Um, lockpicks, I grabbed the auto meds too, maybe we don't need that many AutoMeds. If two of us have it, then we have 10… 10 shots, right, or 10 pills?

[Dex] 23:35:13
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:35:15
Uh, but it repels disease. Those seem really nice.

[Ink] 23:35:20
Um, but the… so the cybernetic scanner allows us to scan Androids and cybernetics for physical and mental issues.

[Ink] 23:35:27
Distrusted by Android, so I thought that might be… to have, especially with all these people with cyber mods.

[Dex] 23:35:34
You've been waving it around at Murderbot.

[Ink] 23:35:36
Yeah.

[Murderbot] 23:35:38
So, this mod, we're literally, we're going in there to break up a drug ring, right?

[Murderbot] 23:35:43
That's… that's the deal, that's our… that's our jam right now, right?

[Ink] 23:35:47
That's our jam.

[Murderbot] 23:35:48
Okay.

[GM] 23:36:21
It has found… Ambient music.

[GM] 23:36:25
Or… per… the module we're playing.

[GM] 23:36:31
It's not good.

[Zeke] 23:36:31
Oh, nice.

[Murderbot] 23:36:36
This is the Cyberpunk Chick soundtrack?

[GM] 23:36:39
No, I don't… no, it's actually… It's specifically made for…

[Murderbot] 23:36:43
Both Erie. Oh, we don't like Erie.

[GM] 23:36:44
Yeah.

[GM] 23:36:50
Guess it's called the person who posts is called the Guild of Black Crow.

[Murderbot] 23:36:56
Oh, jeez.

[GM] 23:36:57
Nice. Um… Maybe that's spelled Mothership for…

[GM] 23:37:03
To avoid some sort of trademark. No, no, this is, uh, the…

[Ink] 23:37:03
GM, did you… is this a mission that you created, or is this another…

[GM] 23:37:09
The, um, module's called The Pound of Flesh.

[Ink] 23:37:13
And then the last one took us, what, about 4 sessions?

[GM] 23:37:17
Yeah, this one's a lot longer, kind of, um… But it's also more… more of the same insofar as I don't think you'll see all the parts of it.

[GM] 23:37:27
It's kind of open-ended. I'm…

[Ink] 23:37:31
Okay, so we shouldn't expect, like, in the next two sessions to find the head of the thing, and then, like.

[Ink] 23:37:37
Take the giant weapon that Karnock has and start shooting shit in, yeah.

[GM] 23:37:42
I wouldn't expect it, though.

[Carnoc] 23:37:43
They didn't let me take it off the ship.

[Dex] 23:37:45
Yeah, we're in big trouble if we take it off the ship.

[Ink] 23:37:48
So is everybody else.

[Dex] 23:37:50
True. Only if they're far away.

[Carnoc] 23:37:50
Yeah. Yeah.

[GM] 23:37:55
Yeah. Far away…

[Ink] 23:37:57
Yes, that's right. It's not a melee weapon.

[Carnoc] 23:37:58
I don't think it's a close quarters interior space station weapon.

[Dex] 23:38:08
I don't know, I feel like Carnage could use it as a melee weapon.

[Dex] 23:38:11
Although it might not be any good as a sniper rifle after that.

[GM] 23:38:22
Hazard pay.

[GM] 23:44:37
The first decontamination photo, Zeke looks so happy to be contaminated.

[GM] 23:44:45
He's like, this is my favorite part.
