[Ink] 21:32:07
It's not on all the, uh, like, cable channels or something like that? The news?

[GM] 21:32:13
We're quite far out here in deep space, in room space.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:17
you already know the answer to that question.

[Ink] 21:32:20
Shoot, so we don't have no proof for her. We can say yes.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:22
Stop asking.

[Ink] 21:32:24
Does anybody have one of those holo projectors that recorded it?

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:30
Don't I have, like… a memory thing, where I record everything at… that I see, or no?

[Dex Miro] 21:32:31
Amazing.

[GM] 21:32:36
I don't know if you do. There is a thing that does that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:38
Don't I have a black box?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:32:39
Do you have that ocular implant thing?

[Dex Miro] 21:32:42
Wasn't that really expensive? I don't think I could afford it, so I didn't get it.

[Dex Miro] 21:32:48
Or am I just thinking of the one that does the backups?

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:49
Um…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:32:51
The backup one was expe… Expensive, yeah.

[Ink] 21:32:51
I think it's the back of the most expensive… let's see, did any of this…

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:54
Okay, I lied.

[GM] 21:33:00
I mean, does anyone have a black box? Did Murderbot have a black box?

[Ink] 21:33:02
Yeah, so, like, Murderbot has a black box, for sure.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:03
No.

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:05
I have a black box.

[Ink] 21:33:07
Because we were worried the black box was going to get downloaded, that's why we hit him.

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:12
Yeah, I do have a black box, that's right.

[GM] 21:33:13
Well…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:18
I mean, how is this not obvious that this happened, right? I mean, it would have been…

[GM] 21:33:18
I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:21
Yeah, I've been huge. I've been news all around. Hold on.

[Ink] 21:33:24
Do you have a projector? Do you have a holo projector, Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:28
No, I don't think so.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:28
Elon Musk is dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:32
Elon Musk is dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:35
It wouldn't be a secret.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:33:36
What?

[GM] 21:33:36
Is that what we're just calling the CEO?

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:38
Oh, I thought you were, like, reading a news thing. I was like, holy sh… Shit, what the fuck?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:44
So you wouldn't need me to read it to you, you would know.

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:45
Oh, they're fucking taking out this administration, dammit! Holy shit!

[GM] 21:33:45
Um…

[Ink] 21:33:49
A holo projector is only 750 credit. Murderbot, did you get one of those?

[Murderbot V2] 21:33:53
I did not get a holo projector.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:54
No, he's some… we were confused because he has the holo pet, but not the holo projector.

[Ink] 21:33:58
Yeah, okay.

[GM] 21:34:02
She… she… you don't have to sh… like, she's like, I can… you know, we can either… we can either plug in and download from him, or… I can…

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:04
Download…

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:10
Yeah, just plugging and download… no, don't plug in. I don't like people plugging things into me.

[Ink] 21:34:10
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:12
So the… the timing was pretty excellent. kind of thought that you had a…

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:16
How about this? I'll plug in a USB stick and upload this stuff onto the stick, and then you can watch.

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:22
The USB stick, there you go.

[GM] 21:34:23
Yeah, she shrugs. She's like, that's fine. She's like, I'll take you at your word, though, that you did… did the thing.

[Ink] 21:34:26
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:31
Trying to pluck shit into me? Yeah, we did as you told.

[Ink] 21:34:33
Yeah, we did the thing, shit blew up. Unfortunately, we lost our ship, that's why we're in a different one.

[GM] 21:34:38
Huh, uh-huh. Well, you're all still here, so that's better than what I anticipated.

[Ink] 21:34:40
Things went a little… little sideways?

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:49
What the fuck? You didn't expect us back?

[GM] 21:34:51
Um… I wasn't entirely sure.

[GM] 21:34:56
It seemed to be… I'll show you some… quite a bit of versatility to… be able to get in and out of a heavily armed.

[GM] 21:35:04
corporate ship. That's… that's not… no… no easy feat.

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:11
Likely story.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:12
Yeah, especially after they drugged us and realized what.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:15
We were there for it, and then we still managed to get out.

[Ink] 21:35:17
I don't need to manage that, mention that out loud.

[GM] 21:35:21
She waves her hand, she's like, you know, I'll see it in the recording, right?

[GM] 21:35:25
She actually would not see that part of the recording, since…

[Ink] 21:35:28
No. It's… yeah, stabbing people and hiding on the ship.

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:28
No, she would see me… stabbing a guy with a penknife.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:32
Yeah.

[GM] 21:35:37
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:35:37
So, uh, we were kind of wondering, the timing was pretty convenient, uh, how did… How did you know when to detonate it?

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:46
This… this is gonna be good.

[GM] 21:35:46
I mean, I didn't detonate it, um… there was a remote signal sent.

[Murderbot V2] 21:35:51
Whoa.

[GM] 21:35:55
Um, but I'm not gonna… I'm not gonna reveal all of my… all of my tricks.

[GM] 21:36:01
Let's just say that, you know, could've been… Biorhythms, could have been wireless signals, who knows? But… Um, yes, the bomb was indeed tied to… something about you all.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:15
All right, well, we appreciate you not blowing us up.

[GM] 21:36:19
Yeah, like I said, I couldn't be sure that you would all make it, but, you know.

[GM] 21:36:24
At least one of you would. Maybe.

[GM] 21:36:33
Um… So.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:36:33
I thought that one would be Zeke, I know, but…

[GM] 21:36:38
How much did I… how much do I owe you?

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:41
50 million.

[GM] 21:36:44
Hmm… I don't think that that was the… agreed upon price.

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:48
Oh, yeah? Do you remember then? Why'd you ask us?

[GM] 21:36:53
I'm trying to establish a… relationship of trust and honesty here.

[Murderbot V2] 21:36:57
Oh, yeah? We don't like being tested. Because we know exactly what you know, and you know what you exactly promised us.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:36:59
what was it?

[Dex Miro] 21:37:01
I didn't really… Didn't Murderbot negotiate for a million each?

[GM] 21:37:03
You know, it's been…

[Ink] 21:37:07
Yes, I believe so.

[GM] 21:37:09
It's been… it's… It's been 6 months since I've seen you.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:09
She knows this. Don't help her! Yes?

[GM] 21:37:16
Uh, many things have come to pass in between now and then.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:19
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 21:37:19
So, I'll take it as… a sign of good faith, if you remind me.

[GM] 21:37:27
Of how much I owe ya.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:28
$1 trillion dollars!

[Ink] 21:37:33
1 million apiece is what credits apiece is over.

[Ink] 21:37:37
Agreed on.

[GM] 21:37:39
She, uh, nods to Ingus, and she says. you'll find those credits in your accounts.

[GM] 21:37:47
Um, note, those are accounts that are… you know, held here on Prospero's dream.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:37:54
Or they just got store credit?

[GM] 21:37:56
You wouldn't want to try and, like… have that be transferred into a corporate account.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:07
I'm all mine in crypto.

[Ink] 21:38:09
These are traceable credits, what?

[GM] 21:38:12
Let's just say that, you know. Perhaps, uh, if… If you've been identified by the corporation.

[GM] 21:38:21
Any… anything that goes into any of your corporate accounts probably won't be there.

[GM] 21:38:25
In the future.

[Ink] 21:38:29
Alright, so we had a… Another comma to our, uh…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:38:39
Do we get a million each, or do we get… Okay.

[Ink] 21:38:42
That was… that was the agreed-upon thing, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:38:44
A million each.

[Dex Miro] 21:38:54
Yeah, so how do we work that, GM, if it's not, like… real money, it's more like Prospero's Dream Bucks.

[GM] 21:39:02
Um… I mean, it's just like having a different bank account.

[Murderbot V2] 21:39:02
I mean, the credits are good here, everything is still in credits, right?

[GM] 21:39:09
It's not that… it's not that you can't use it anywhere, it's just that these were accounts that she created for you, because… Like, she didn't want, like, any previous way in which you were storing your credits, you'd want to give…

[GM] 21:39:21
put money there, unless… It could be, like, taken by the corporation.

[GM] 21:39:28
So you can use this money anywhere, it's just not…

[Dex Miro] 21:39:30
Okay. They'll just know where it came from.

[Ink] 21:39:34
just… we don't have…

[GM] 21:39:37
Right.

[Ink] 21:39:42
How about that next job? What's the next job?

[GM] 21:39:45
Uh, that's… that's on Ingus. I'm just kind of turns and looks at him, and she's like, I honestly… I don't know the details, I don't know if I care to know.

[GM] 21:39:57
Um… I might have some work for you in the future.

[GM] 21:40:01
But I'll be in touch. With that, she turns and she leaves.

[Ink] 21:40:03
Okay.

[GM] 21:40:08
Um… Ingus, uh… Spins around in his chair and grabs a handful of Cheetos.

[GM] 21:40:17
pops them in his mouth, and… Looks his orange finger.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:22
So I think it's like Dennis Nedry, here, hear what's happening.

[GM] 21:40:25
Uh, I mean, yes and no. That's kind of where I'm leaning a little bit, but you can also… you know, he doesn't quite look like Dennis Nedry on account of he's got all these mods and stuff, like…

[Dex Miro] 21:40:29
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:35
What'd you got for us, Dennis? I mean, Ingus?

[GM] 21:40:35
Go back to… Um, so Ingus is the one that's on the… left here.

[GM] 21:40:46
Um… well, you see. I found a signal.

[GM] 21:40:52
And that signal comes from a trace back, bounced off a few relays.

[GM] 21:40:58
It's from an old, uh. Android facility.

[GM] 21:41:03
laid out, uh, also… in a different galaxy.

[GM] 21:41:09
Um. And I found that Android… Not that far away. Couple jumps.

[Murderbot V2] 21:41:12
far, far away.

[GM] 21:41:17
Well, it'll be a couple jumps. Um, and… Turns out, there's something really interesting.

[GM] 21:41:25
Besides the androids they were producing. They also had a strong AI program that they were running.

[GM] 21:41:32
I don't know what kind of research they were doing with it, but… There was a happy, happy, uh.

[GM] 21:41:40
occurrence, uh, that few people know about. Which is that it developed a model.

[GM] 21:41:46
Predictive model of economies. And I would like you to retrieve that model for me.

[GM] 21:41:57
Unfortunately, the facility's been shut down and is now heavily guarded by the corporation.

[GM] 21:42:03
Nothing gets in or out.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:07
We can travel to other galaxies.

[GM] 21:42:11
Yeah, by jumping.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:16
I mean, decks probably do that, but Dex didn't.

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:22
This is the same company that we just blew up the CEO.

[GM] 21:42:26
Oh, yeah. But that was a subsidiary. It's a good chance that they won't even know that you did that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:27
Oh.

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:31
how highly secure is this thing?

[GM] 21:42:35
Uh, pretty damn secure. So, being…

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:39
like, an army couldn't take it over?

[GM] 21:42:43
Uh, yeah, no, they've got at least 4 cruisers that are just patrolling around the station.

[GM] 21:42:48
I've…

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:48
And

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:51
to get in there after having murdered the CEO of one of their subsidiaries.

[GM] 21:42:56
like I said, they probably won't even know that you did it.

[GM] 21:43:00
It's a big universe. You'd think that… like, what? You have, like, some sci-fi idea how fast information travels here? I mean, it's like…

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:00
Apparently…

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:09
Well, apparently if we travel to get another galaxy, it's gonna take 4 million years for the information to get back to Earth, so…

[GM] 21:43:17
Yeah, basically… they won't even basically know. Now, you potentially… you know, could tell them that, but I don't know why you would do that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:30
What's the payout? Each… Oh, yeah, and we're not made out of lives!

[GM] 21:43:31
$350 million. Oh, total. Jesus, I'm not made of money.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:32
What?

[GM] 21:43:41
I mean… do you take it or leave it?

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:44
What's $350 million… what, $7 million each? $70 million each? Oh yeah, that's right. But there's an extra… Extra zero there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:44
Take it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:48
Take it!

[GM] 21:43:48
70 million.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:50
Twitter bot is the login negotiator.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:55
Um… What the fuck are we gonna do with all this money? I don't even know what we can buy with a million credits.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:02
Didn't you remember how much the ships cost?

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:05
How much do the shifts cost? Are we looking for a new ship? What is our goal here? What are we looking to buy?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:44:10
Well, get… Can our ship even go between galaxies?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:44:14
Or do we have to buy a different ship?

[GM] 21:44:14
Yeah. I mean, uh, I mean, you'll need a couple jumps, which means you'll probably need to refuel, but… Yeah, you could probably do it.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:28
I stuck a USB in my neck. Ink, you're… you're muted.

[Ink] 21:44:34
We have a company, SHIP, right? So that might help us pass… path.

[GM] 21:44:36
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:44:37
Now, we do need a ship.

[Ink] 21:44:40
through some stuff. Um, he can get us maps to jump points.

[GM] 21:44:45
Yeah, I can get you there.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:47
Dude, that was… Ink, that was really sensual… a sensual way for Carnoc To say the… the buzzword.

[Ink] 21:44:50
Any information?

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:00
Uh, it's… it's either Murderbot's being turned on, or…

[Ink] 21:45:07
Sparks. Um, does he have any additional information that might help us infiltrate this place?

[GM] 21:45:16
Um… I mean… Let's see…

[Ink] 21:45:23
And I guess, how do we know what we are looking for exactly? Like, I guess the… So we can find this. And what form… it's a software program we're gonna bring back?

[Ink] 21:45:32
Essentially.

[GM] 21:45:33
Yeah, it's a… it's… it's an economic model, um… Uh, I imagine it'll probably stand… out insofar as that I don't think that… The research on the, uh… And the station was really meant to do that, it just sort of happened… happened to come about.

[GM] 21:45:51
Um. I don't know how we're gonna get past the blockade. Uh, I did hear that there's… Often… Runners, um… Basically, they try to… run the blockade. If their ship's fast enough, they can, uh…

[GM] 21:46:10
They can get in… into the station. Getting off is another issue, um… And maybe try to just go stealth?

[GM] 21:46:20
you know, sneak by in the blockade. I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:24
So it's a… it's a suicide mission.

[GM] 21:46:25
Yeah. I will admit, I've sent a couple teams, and they've not come back.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:46:36
How do you know if they're still on their way? Haven't even arrived yet.

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:40
Yeah, they could still be on the job.

[GM] 21:46:43
Uh, it's been a few years. I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 21:46:47
They could be heavily embedded in…

[Dex Miro] 21:46:50
And his third, is there anything that might help us run that blockade?

[Dex Miro] 21:46:56
That you can think of.

[GM] 21:46:59
That I can think of. Um, I mean…

[Ink] 21:47:05
Oh, you know, going in stealth. What about the stealth aspect?

[GM] 21:47:05
Nope.

[GM] 21:47:09
I mean… I don't know. I don't know anything about ships.

[GM] 21:47:13
I'm all about data.

[Ink] 21:47:17
You might point us to somebody that can give us some stealth tech?

[Dex Miro] 21:47:20
Well, can you just, like, make our ship show up as a… everybody's just gonna overlook us, because we're a routine craft that's been there multiple times.

[GM] 21:47:32
Um, I mean, if you wanna… A bunch of backstory, I can… I could program that into your… like, rewrite some… some… stuff on your ship, but I'm sure you guys could probably do that, too.

[Ink] 21:47:49
And it sounds like we're getting about all we can out of him.

[Ink] 21:47:52
Um… We're gonna go… we can go relax a little while, right? He's not in a super hurry?

[GM] 21:47:59
I'm in no hurry.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:00
Um, hold on, um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:06
this… what did you… you just called it? It's a model that we have to pull out?

[Ink] 21:48:09
economic model.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:11
an economic model that we have to download into something, like a hard drive or something?

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:15
Is that correct?

[Dex Miro] 21:48:16
You know, what… do we know how we would store that?

[GM] 21:48:17
Yeah, but… I'm sure… you'll be on a facility that makes Androids. There's all gonna be all kinds of, uh… data storage devices.

[Ink] 21:48:27
We upload MurderBot to a… a bunch of different Androids that have an army of MurderBots.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:30
That'd be awesome. And then… and then Karnak accidentally says the word…

[GM] 21:48:32
Yeah, yeah, sure.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:37
Nice, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:39
June.

[Dex Miro] 21:48:41
They'll all say snake eyes on the front, but they'll all show different numbers.

[Ink] 21:48:57
Alright, so, well, I guess we've… We might give it a shot. We're gonna go relax for a while.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:03
No, you can go… we could go, uh… flying out and, uh… Get some more mods, or get some rest, and reduce some stress, or…

[Ink] 21:49:12
Looking to make in our… get some stealth tech.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:16
How long, in terms of real-time. would this run take if we're successful?

[GM] 21:49:24
Uh, how long do you anticipate, like. from start of launch to, like, you returning to Prospero Stream.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:31
Yeah.

[GM] 21:49:32
Based on just, like, the distances he shows you in the map and stuff.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:35
Right, like, I know We'll be in crowds leave, but I'm just wondering how long… how much time will pass.

[GM] 21:49:36
Um…

[GM] 21:49:40
Yeah, probably… Maybe a year?

[Dex Miro] 21:49:44
Okay. Just curious, since she said it was 6 months since last time.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:46
Why do you ask?

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:51
Oh, I see, okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:50:04
I was just wondering if we should start asking for interest in our bank accounts? I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:08
Well, I think they're interest-bearing. Break accounts, right?

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:13
Right? Right, GM?

[Dex Miro] 21:50:15
Doubt it. In fact, they might have fees if you keep asking.

[GM] 21:50:18
I mean… uh… you have to choose how you want to invest your funds. There's no central banking system on Prospero Stream.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:19
Right, Yandy?

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:29
Who's the biggest chip maker?

[GM] 21:50:33
The primary export of Prospero's Dream is a drug called Sycorax.

[GM] 21:50:39
You did not notice any type of, uh, chip… Manufacturing. That being said, there is also a heavy modding community, so… you know, those chips gotta be come from somewhere, I guess.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:52
Exactly.

[Dex Miro] 21:50:52
I don't think you're gonna, like, buy stock on the Solarian Farms or something.

[Ink] 21:50:56
Is there… there's somebody that you can point us to on the station that might help us mod our ship for, uh, stealth?

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:58
Bad.

[Ink] 21:51:05
Tech.

[GM] 21:51:06
Uh… I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:06
Or can we buy a stealth ship? Outright.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:10
Or would that be too much money? I can't remember the numbers.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:13
Hold on, let me pull up the manuals that you sent us.

[GM] 21:51:19
Um, you should talk to the, um… the guy who works on the docks.

[GM] 21:51:25
Uh, what's his name? Hold on. He, like, punches into his computer.

[GM] 21:51:30
Uh, Loshi. Dr. Loshi, he should… he should have some… some… some idea about ships.

[Murderbot V2] 21:51:31
the docs.

[GM] 21:51:41
He's always working on ships. There's always repairs and shit going on in the docks.

[GM] 21:51:46
I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 21:51:52
Loshi?

[GM] 21:51:54
I think that's the same.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:11
For this is… sounds like it might be expensive. Is there any chance of us getting a… Small advance on them.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:18
Payment for this mission to… make us have a chance at succeeding.

[GM] 21:52:26
Uh, Andy just paid you 5 million credits. I think that, uh… I'm not as trusting as she is.

[GM] 21:52:33
Uh, like I said, I've already probably lost a couple teams, and… you know, I might have… I might have made the… Mistake one, so I'm not gonna make the mistake again of putting money in a counselor, they just disappear.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:45
All right.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:52
I wonder if there's a… Maybe we can charter a ship.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:58
they might have a better chance of getting through then, because we can't afford our own shit.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:03
They're both 5 million.

[Ink] 21:53:04
We have a company ship, though, that's… that's one thing I think would be an advantage. Maybe we can get a legit.

[Ink] 21:53:10
passage through, if we had…

[Dex Miro] 21:53:12
I guess, with our current ship, we do look very non-threatening, because we are very non-threatening.

[Ink] 21:53:18
So we might try to cruise through, you know, on, uh… With now, you know, without some way that might not set enough sensors, or that were supposed to be there, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:53:27
Yeah, so it's more like the… Stealth just by looking like we belong there, I guess.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:34
the actual stealth, but that's… Seems reasonable.

[Ink] 21:53:34
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:39
I guess, uh… Before we go, can we ask Ingus, like, is there any kind of cover story? Like, is there any reason somebody might have to… go to this Android installation.

[GM] 21:53:55
Uh…

[GM] 21:54:02
I honestly… I don't know. the… I think they closed it down because the Androids went berserk or something, so… maybe… maybe you're… if you were a company cleanup time, trying to, like.

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:11
Seems highly unlikely.

[GM] 21:54:17
basically kill all the androids on the station.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:21
Oh, we should have taken the repurposing department uniforms.

[Ink] 21:54:24
Yeah, I mean, we know what to look like, we can get some made.

[Ink] 21:54:28
Yeah, so let's go in with that covers. Sorry, we're… we're gonna take out the robots, maybe not, like, by a forced team, but, like, by a virus or shutdown type of thing. We got some… disabling tech?

[Dex Miro] 21:54:40
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:54:41
And maybe we should invest in more of that disabling tech. Isn't that one of the things we can buy?

[Ink] 21:54:52
what was that called?

[Murderbot V2] 21:54:56
Zeke is… gone.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:54:59
I'm not gone.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:02
Like, you're still there?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:04
Claire, hello.

[Ink] 21:55:07
We should always psionic attack that overloads target electronics.

[Ink] 21:55:13
Is that… is that something… that we can use over and over again?

[Ink] 21:55:21
I guess it's slickware, so yeah, okay. Okay, I want to go get some slickware installed.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:24
It should.

[GM] 21:55:30
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:55:31
I want to buy the Espernetic feedback loop.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:37
Red or Bot already have that, or somebody else already has that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:37
Oh yeah, we had the…

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:39
I have it. I got all of it.

[Ink] 21:55:40
Yeah, oh, okay, maybe I don't need it then.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:44
can afford more stuff now, though.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:45
I'll tell you what I got. I've got… at God Mode, Espernetic.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:47
You've got too many things for God.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:50
VoxBox and Looky-loo.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:52
You're not allowed to install any more things, you're full.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:55
Oh, that's right.

[Ink] 21:56:05
Yeah, I want to swap my VoxBox for Espernetic Feedback Loop.

[Ink] 21:56:10
Can I, like, put my slickware somewhere else so I can… swapped slickware in and out.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:18
You could get a hot swap. Oh wait, was that first liquid, or for…

[Ink] 21:56:21
That was for changing out cyberware, but it seems…

[GM] 21:56:23
Yeah, yeah, you can… you can swap them in and out. I mean, it… requires a specific type of terminal.

[GM] 21:56:31
That can allow for the… data transfer, but, um… Yeah, like, it's, you know… Right, right, you just have it backed up on some sort of data.

[Ink] 21:56:36
I won't have to buy any… I won't have to buy it again, it would be…

[GM] 21:56:42
stick, and after that.

[Ink] 21:56:43
But I'd like to go and, yeah, get that, and I'll give up my VoxBox for right now, put it on, uh, in storage.

[Ink] 21:56:49
If they have a place to do that, I'm assuming, here.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:51
What was the cost? I thought we had it in this spreadsheet, but I can't see, I can't find it. The cost for, like, the…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:57
hear what they call them. Like, the bodies.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:01
That you could. The sleeves, yeah.

[Ink] 21:57:02
Oh, the sleeves that you could buy. Um, I didn't put it in the… spreadsheet, but I did write them down somewhere.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:09
Those are…

[Ink] 21:57:13
Oh, I had a transcript of that, that's where that was.

[GM] 21:57:14
The reclamation sleeve. uh, is $300,000.

[GM] 21:57:20
The Model A is 500,000, the Atlas X Premium is $3 million.

[GM] 21:57:26
And the narcissus 1 sleeve is $50 million.

[Ink] 21:57:29
So you could actually afford some sleeves now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:30
Yeah, what do you get for the… what's the Model A?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:32
I put a link in the chat.

[GM] 21:57:34
Built by memory-wiping prisoners, re-roll stats, 10% chance of learning a random skill, 10% chance of gaining someone else's memories.

[Ink] 21:57:41
I thought that was a reclamation one. Oh, he said not.

[GM] 21:57:43
That's what he asked. Oh, sorry. Model A is bulk issue, 10 different physical models A1 through A10.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:44
No, the Model A, the…

[GM] 21:57:51
Reduce all stats and saves by 5, I've really discriminated against.

[Ink] 21:57:56
Oh, you're gonna look like everybody else. It's like, uh… It's like what's inside the clones.

[GM] 21:57:58
Good. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:01
Yeah. I said, like, in the early 20… Like, I put a link in the Roll20 that you… Has all of it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:02
A prisoner one sounds better.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:05
What? Oh, you put a link at all.

[Ink] 21:58:11
Yeah, the only problem with the prisoner one is that you might go nuts, right? Or get somebody else's memories?

[GM] 21:58:16
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:58:18
Now, can you be in both at once? Like, you can just upload your consciousness to the other one, so there's two of you?

[GM] 21:58:23
I don't see why not.

[Dex Miro] 21:58:27
Gonna get into some arguments with yourself, probably.

[Ink] 21:58:31
Yeah, well, I mean, but obviously you're the clone, yeah.

[Ink] 21:58:37
Nobody saw… what's… what is that? Anybody watch Invincible? The, uh, cartoon?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:39
What does that teleportation argument?

[GM] 21:58:44
Yeah. Yeah, the… were they doctors, scientists? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:45
Yep.

[Ink] 21:58:46
You know, do you know what I'm talking about, GM?

[Ink] 21:58:50
Yeah, they're like doctors, yeah.

[GM] 21:58:53
Always just cloning themselves.

[Ink] 21:58:56
they clone themselves, and they don't let each one know which is a clone, so they're always arguing.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:00
Oh, dear.

[Ink] 21:59:01
About it.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:08
And sleeves are expensive.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:12
Not much.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:14
I mean, the two that we can afford are $300 or $500K.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:23
the luxury model is $50 million.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:29
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:32
Which, if we succeed in our mission, it could happen.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:36
But personally, I'd rather spend the money on a ship.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:40
I mean, the 3 million's pretty solid.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:41
Yeah. any of the more robust ship, for sure.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:49
Can you sell these? Like, do they have market value? Like, if I bought a Model A, $500,000 and I don't use it, can I sell it back?

[GM] 21:59:59
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:01
Probably a fraction of the price.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:04
I mean, is it, like, a used car?

[GM] 22:00:07
I was like, how are you… transporting it around. Like, what are you doing with it?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:11
Well, it's just like a backup body, right? That's what you do with them, isn't it?

[GM] 22:00:16
Well, here's the thing. So, you sleeve backup is $50,000, so basically.

[GM] 22:00:21
You could download, uh, your memories for $50,000 a year.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:26
Oh.

[GM] 22:00:28
And then… You know, if someone wants to come and, you know.

[GM] 22:00:34
install your backup into a sleeve, then you pay for it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:37
That's fine, I'll pay $50,000 then for that.

[GM] 22:00:40
Okay. All right, uh…

[GM] 22:00:49
Zeke goes off, and it takes 24 hours. They plug you into a machine.

[GM] 22:00:55
Make a sanity save.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:57
Beep, beep.

[Dex Miro] 22:00:57
So you're paying $50,000 for what?

[Ink] 22:01:00
His back is stunted.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:00
to back myself, back myself up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:02
That's like a deal. If I could do that in real life, oh man.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:04
50,000 bucks?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:08
beep, beep! Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:01:09
But, like, don't you have to have enough money to buy a body to restore yourself into, otherwise the backup's worthless?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:15
Well, but it… but it's…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:17
See, it sits there for a while, so, you know…

[Ink] 22:01:20
So you also have money in the bank so that it would activate if you don't come back, like, in a year or something, and then get access to your credit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:29
Yeah, I don't know how to, like…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:31
you know, put it in your will or something to…

[Ink] 22:01:34
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:36
I'm sure this is a subscription cost.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:37
One step at a time.

[Ink] 22:01:41
Well, at least you have the backup.

[GM] 22:01:42
Alright, you're backed up.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:47
So that's, like, backing up his whole brain.

[GM] 22:01:49
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:52
Alright. Got to have one to my money.

[Ink] 22:01:57
Can I… can I get… Espernetic feedback loop, um… installed.

[GM] 22:02:03
Uh, would you like to take… wait, does Sycorax help with this?

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:07
Yes.

[Ink] 22:02:08
It's slickware, it's not cyber.

[GM] 22:02:09
I know, that's why I'm checking to see if… I can't… I can't remember.

[GM] 22:02:16
Okay. Procedure takes 24 hours, where is the sanity save?

[GM] 22:02:24
Wait, no, no, no, that's… that's the Nemo machine.

[GM] 22:02:48
That's, uh…

[GM] 22:02:56
So, underneath the Babushka?

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:58
Babushka!

[GM] 22:03:03
Still in Slickware. Okay, here we are. Where is Sandy Save.

[GM] 22:03:08
Um, with Advantage.

[GM] 22:03:14
Let's go ahead and make that.

[Ink] 22:03:18
Sanity save… Advantage…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:24
Oh.

[Ink] 22:03:25
It went insane.

[GM] 22:03:27
Um… I think 97 is just a normal failure.

[Ink] 22:03:34
Really bad.

[GM] 22:03:41
Um… Failure means the mod is installed, but the character gains stress equal to number of slots being installed.

[Ink] 22:03:49
So we get one stress. Right. Now, can I go do things to relieve stress? Can we go on short leave or whatever?

[GM] 22:03:51
There we go.

[GM] 22:03:56
Sure. Did anyone else want to do anything potentially stressful before going on shore leave?

[Ink] 22:04:00
Forget hell.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:00
I really won't. I don't think so.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:07
I really want Carnoc to get the, uh… We'll be Mark II, sock puppet.

[GM] 22:04:07
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:14
you don't know what the sock puppet is? Wait, did we even take the Wolver Mark II with us?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:04:15
No.

[GM] 22:04:21
Uh, yes. I think everyone had, uh… a gun at the end.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:04:21
I think so.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:23
We did. Okay.

[Ink] 22:04:26
And we definitely got his gun back. So, you think he can fit it in his arm?

[GM] 22:04:28
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:31
Uh, I don't know. It didn't seem to have any space requirements.

[Ink] 22:04:35
Oh, it's a spinal rip, never mind.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:38
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:04:46
Well, that's cool. So, like, just… is on his back.

[Dex Miro] 22:04:48
Yeah, like, he can shoot other weapons, but it just, like…

[Dex Miro] 22:04:55
It seems excessive, but…

[GM] 22:04:59
If you… if he does attach it to himself like that.

[GM] 22:05:03
Uh, he may knock himself over when firing, standing up.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:08
Yeah, well, I have just one gun when you can have two for twice the price?

[Ink] 22:05:16
Did I have a picture of the Wilbur Mark II here?

[Dex Miro] 22:05:21
I mean, I feel like

[GM] 22:05:35
That's his fancy gun he got.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:42
There was a picture. There is one of him holding it, but it does not show the gun.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:58
Yeah. This… this isn't… this is the closest I can get you, Ink.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:45
Everybody getting updates, upgrades, yadda yadda yadda.

[Dex Miro] 22:10:56
I don't think I'm getting anything. Is Murderbot gonna get anything?

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:58
I can't fit anything anymore, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:10:59
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, just make sure you take a… thoughtful inventory of what you already have.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:05
Let's see here… Right, GM? I can't fit… I don't have any more slots.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:12
or something?

[Dex Miro] 22:11:13
You didn't put all your stuff on your… equipment list.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:16
I have it on my equipment list, but I just have, like, the four different things I have.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:22
I don't… I don't have, like, a thing that, um… that, uh, says, oh, you have these slots available.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:34
I should… I should do something about that, I should.

[Ink] 22:11:37
Your slots should be based on your intelligence, right? Your sleep work?

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:41
Oh, my slash should be my intelligence. That's right.

[Ink] 22:11:44
divided by 10. You had a pretty high intelligence, so you were able to.

[GM] 22:11:45
Kind of. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:11:47
get 4, I think, at least.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:50
4, okay, yeah, so with the four slots, I got this.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:51
Like, where is one slot for every 10 intelligence?

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:55
Right. Okay, but what about, like, physical upgrades and stuff? Like… bodily upgrades.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:57
And cyberware is trying to get up for you transferring.

[GM] 22:12:03
That's your strength divided by 10. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:05
Strength divided by 10. Same divided by 10. I get 3 cyberware upgrades, then, if I'm at 35, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:07
for cyberware.

[GM] 22:12:14
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:15
Uh, let's see, what… where is the… Where's the manual for the cyberware update?

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:21
Great. Did you link that to… Dex?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:25
I just sent both of them in some chat.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:26
Bam. Nice. Alright, cyberware slots. And I got so much money…

[Ink] 22:12:34
GM, can I… can I go talk to Loki while he's doing that?

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:37
Yes, go ahead. Don't mind me, go do your thing. Ooh, I could do cloak skin!

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:41
Yes! Oh, what? Who's got that?

[GM] 22:12:44
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:12:44
Zeke already has that?

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:49
Zeke got it? Oh, that's right. Yeah, Ink, did you get it?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:50
Yeah, don't you remember all the floating spanners?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:50
Period.

[Ink] 22:12:54
No, it was too expensive.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:56
What are you talking about? It's a million… we got a million credits!

[Ink] 22:12:59
Well, before I didn't get it. I didn't get it now, no, no, you're right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:01
Oh. Are you gonna get it now?

[Ink] 22:13:02
I have… I have, uh, because my strength is… is, uh… 45, I could… I could have a third thing.

[Ink] 22:13:10
Because right now, I have a holo projector. an ogre and a slick shot socket is what I did.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:19
Oh, oh, so you got other stuff. Okay, alright, well, I'm gonna look at this stuff. GM, you go do your other stuff with, uh… With them.

[Ink] 22:13:26
Oh, I… I have a holo projector, that's weird. Okay. I don't know what I can do with my holoprojector.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:31
I think you could, like, project, like, your pet or something like that, or something like that, right?

[Ink] 22:13:36
We've… no, no, we don't know if you need a holo projector to have a pet, but I think… I can… I can project data from my… my Ogre. I have an Ogre and something with Slickshot, so I could… I could plug in your USB… I guess I could have plugged in your USB and then project…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:40
It depends in your mind.

[Ink] 22:13:51
Holo projected the data. Or a slick shot… a slick… a slick socket USB drive.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:52
That would have been interesting.

[GM] 22:14:01
Um… This is, I mean, he would be getting modded at the same time you're getting your slickware installed.

[GM] 22:14:08
Um, so it's not really, like… You're waiting on him?

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:13
actual audio surveillance bug, which can be traced up to 100 kilometers.

[GM] 22:14:15
Um…

[Ink] 22:14:18
Or he could come with us as well, assuming he does die.

[GM] 22:14:20
Well, here's the thing, I'm not sure if Murderbot has any space.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:21
What are my interface with that? Oh, really? Oh, because I already have… I'm already, uh…

[Ink] 22:14:21
Again.

[GM] 22:14:26
4. So… A slick socket is one.

[GM] 22:14:31
Uh, you have a dead switch, which is one. You have a black box, which is 1.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:34
Motherfucker!

[GM] 22:14:38
Um, maybe you have one space, but I don't know if you have an ogre or not?

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:45
I think you said I had an ogre. Did you? Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:48
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we talked… Talked about that before.

[GM] 22:14:48
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:51
Okay, so I have all four… oh, I can't even upgrade, never mind then.

[GM] 22:14:55
Yeah. I mean, you could… you could get stuff uninstalled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:56
Motherfuck! Hold on, I'm gonna add… Ooh!

[Ink] 22:15:04
You can get the hot swap for $5,000. 5,000 credit, and then allows you a one-turn change of cyberware.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:12
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:13
Do you have to get your carnoc's permission to remove the panic button?

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:17
Oh, that's right, yeah, I could get rid of my, uh, my, uh… that switch, or whatever.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:25
The panic button.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:26
Now, the panic button. Although, oh shit, what did that open up?

[GM] 22:15:32
Yeah, sorry, I said Dead Switch, I think, but…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:15:39
So, you can always get rid of it just by saying the word.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:40
But that's huge.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:40
Chop chop. shut up. Shut up.

[Ink] 22:15:43
Mm-hmm.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:15:43
goes away.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:47
I mean, then you'd have to restore from his backup.

[GM] 22:15:52
Okay. So, Zeke… Or not Zeke, um… I was going to talk to him.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:59
Ingus, yeah.

[GM] 22:16:00
Ink. Ink's going to talk to Loshi. All right, um… You head down to the docks, docking, uh, bays, the… Um… noticeably, like, colder, uh, when you enter into the dock areas.

[GM] 22:16:19
some of the bays are closed off because they're, uh… open to just space.

[GM] 22:16:24
But some smaller ships are in… while they're getting repaired, or fueling up are in… Uh, enclosed bays.

[GM] 22:16:34
Um… You ask around about Loshi, people know who you're talking about, um… Uh, but… and that direct you to his office.

[GM] 22:16:44
And his office is in, uh… has a sort of nice view of the… one of the… repair bays, um… And, uh, a Teamster who's, like.

[GM] 22:16:55
Standing nearby his office. basically indicates that he's out.

[GM] 22:17:01
Although she's out doing repairs. I'm looking out on the repair bay you see.

[GM] 22:17:05
a man working in, uh. Exoskeleton.

[GM] 22:17:10
basically, um… Similar to the one from Aliens. Did you watch it yet, Ink?

[Ink] 22:17:15
No, I haven't, no, I haven't.

[GM] 22:17:16
Okay. Well, now you know there's exoskeletons in it.

[GM] 22:17:21
Um, and so, like, they're like. we'll… we'll send a… message down to them and have them come up.

[GM] 22:17:30
You see them sort of, like, get the message, and then… He leaves the… moves out of sight, um, a few… A few minutes later, uh, he kind of walks up. He's kind of this short guy.

[GM] 22:17:44
Um… And I'm gonna… we're on the picture of the peoples.

[GM] 22:17:52
page, let me reveal…

[Ink] 22:17:54
Oh, we have more character? Oh, there's a lot more people that potentially are dealing with, huh?

[GM] 22:17:57
Yeah. So he's the one that… This is the bottom left.

[Dex Miro] 22:17:57
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:03
Yes, he's a smoker, too.

[GM] 22:18:05
smokes… lights up a cigarette as he approaches. What can I do for you?

[Ink] 22:18:12
Um, we are interested in trying to get through a company blockade. We have a small company ship.

[Ink] 22:18:20
Um, and so we're, uh. any interest in any mods, modification, advice that we might solicit from you?

[Ink] 22:18:28
Um, maybe even some stealth tech. to get… to get by this, uh, blockade.

[GM] 22:18:34
Hmm. Takes a long pull on a cigarette and blows the smoke out through his nose.

[GM] 22:18:39
Don't know much about stealth tech. Uh, there's not… I mean, there's rumors of things out there, I don't… I don't have any… anything near that.

[GM] 22:18:52
Um, but… Might have… some experimental stuff, uh… As far as engine upgrades… Which ship did you say you were at on?

[Ink] 22:19:06
and point to our ship.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:10
Like, guys.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:15
It's kind of… it's a real piece of junk.

[GM] 22:19:16
Um. Yeah, you're telling me. Oh, that's a… that's a piece of shit.

[GM] 22:19:24
I'm spread… where'd you get that from? definitely corporate.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:28
Well, we had to… We had to commandeer it to survive and get out.

[Ink] 22:19:30
Oh, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:33
It was the thing that had feel in it when we had to get out.

[GM] 22:19:38
Uh, alright, let me see. Um… Raider-style ship… Um… Got no weapons installed, no upgrades… Bare bones, got… One coffin lander. Oof.

[GM] 22:19:55
Um… I mean, I think 4 of you can fit in there, but, you know…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:56
open wood.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:01
Oh, okay. I was just under the impression it was individual coffins for each of us.

[GM] 22:20:05
Yeah. Um, let's see…

[Dex Miro] 22:20:09
Also, only four of us.

[GM] 22:20:15
Uh…

[GM] 22:20:20
I think, probably, it will work.

[GM] 22:20:26
Um, hmm…

[Ink] 22:20:29
And what would this… what would this engine do for us?

[GM] 22:20:32
It's experimental. Um… basically, it might make you the fastest ship in the galaxy.

[GM] 22:20:42
Um, that being said, there's also a chance it just blows you the hell out of… space, it's just, you know… I don't know, I've been playing around with some designs. It's a… mostly, um…

[GM] 22:20:55
intended to be, uh, a highly efficient jump drive.

[GM] 22:20:59
But it's also possible to mod it to… you know, increase your travel speed, uh.

[GM] 22:21:06
exponentially beyond most standard. engines. Basically, reroute certain fuel type to different, uh, areas.

[GM] 22:21:16
I think, you know, it's not… not traditionally up to code for most, uh, corporate.

[GM] 22:21:22
shifts on account of, uh… rules and regulations regarding minimization of risk of.

[GM] 22:21:28
company property, but… you know, dealership could be monitored to… to do this.

[GM] 22:21:35
Um… But like I said, there's a risk.

[GM] 22:21:42
Um, I'd be… this… It's extremely expensive tech.

[GM] 22:21:47
Uh, but because it's experimental, I'd probably be willing to knock off quite a few million off the price.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:21:53
50 million.

[Ink] 22:21:54
what are we looking at?

[GM] 22:21:58
Uh, fool… Um, let's see. After the discount?

[Ink] 22:22:03
Yep.

[GM] 22:22:04
Uh, probably 100 million?

[Ink] 22:22:08
Okay, that might be a steeper we can afford today, shoot.

[Ink] 22:22:15
Uh, you don't have a leasing agreement yet. Did you provide financing?

[GM] 22:22:20
Uh, let's see.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:26
Yeah, let's just put it all on credit, because we don't know if we're coming back.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:28
No, no, yeah, no interest for the next 12 months, you know?

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:30
Yeah, can we… oh, we should just buy all our stuff on credit, cause… Who knows if we're all coming back or not?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:37
That's right.

[GM] 22:22:39
Okay, even though your ship's a piece of shit.

[GM] 22:22:44
Um… How about this?

[GM] 22:22:48
Do you think you'll have money like that in the future?

[Ink] 22:22:50
Uh, we're headed out on a mission that, yeah, what did you say it was? 100… 100 million what? What was the… Yeah, we got a job that should pay out that and more, so…

[GM] 22:22:55
100 million is what I would…

[GM] 22:23:01
Alright. Do you… will you go through some legal steps to transfer ownership of that ship to me?

[GM] 22:23:07
Then it's my ship, I'll install it for free on it.

[GM] 22:23:11
And you guys can, essentially. lease it out, as you mentioned.

[GM] 22:23:16
And then when you come into your money, I'll sell it back to you.

[GM] 22:23:19
Same price I bought it at. or the same price that, uh, its market value.

[Ink] 22:23:26
Okay, I think that sounds like a good deal.

[Ink] 22:23:28
Unfortunately, somebody left the, uh, the paperwork in that ship, right? So we can just, uh…

[Ink] 22:23:36
Who owns this damn ship?

[GM] 22:23:39
I mean, you guys more or less own it at this point.

[Ink] 22:23:42
Yeah. I think that sounds a great, great deal.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:47
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:23:49
I think the motto of this universe is, go into debt and take risks, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:23:54
Check those out.

[Ink] 22:23:57
In that order.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:58
What's different from this world?

[GM] 22:24:04
Um… Okay. Uh, let's see.

[GM] 22:24:09
I should have a lawyer friend I could probably call up.

[GM] 22:24:14
This might take a few days to work out, you guys, in any kind of hurry?

[Dex Miro] 22:24:17
No.

[Ink] 22:24:17
No, no, we're not married. Right, we'd like you to install, most likely, best way that it doesn't blow us up into the next universe.

[GM] 22:24:19
Okay.

[GM] 22:24:26
Uh, it's gonna take me a few months to do that.

[Ink] 22:24:28
Okay, let's, uh, we're gonna go relax for a minute then, I guess.

[GM] 22:24:33
Sounds good. Um… he… he finishes the cigarette, um… puts, like, puts out the ash on the wall next to him.

[GM] 22:24:48
Um… Seems a little bit giddy about the idea of, uh.

[GM] 22:24:53
Installing this tech. Um… You know, I haven't done, like, something like this in quite some time.

[GM] 22:25:02
This makes me feel alive. It's even pull out, like, uh, something out of his pocket, and he kind of starts fiddling it with his fingers, he's like… You guys need anything else from me?

[Ink] 22:25:16
Um, unless you got any other suggestions, our mission is to get.

[Ink] 22:25:19
get through someplace, either with speed or stealth, so you're providing us with speed.

[GM] 22:25:26
Okay, well, yeah. Um, okay. He… basically… contacts you a few days later, um… present you with, you know, some paperwork.

[Ink] 22:25:27
We'll let you get to it.

[GM] 22:25:41
Um, everything seems on the up and up. basically is offering… Um, I think that we're gonna go off of the price that's in the book right now.

[GM] 22:25:50
I have to go back and find how I modified the prices of the ships.

[GM] 22:25:54
Um, but the standard

[GM] 22:26:01
And the… the document is $75 million. Um, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:26:03
Right, really? Okay.

[GM] 22:26:09
Um… So he's like, basically, after the install.

[GM] 22:26:14
And the… the ship…

[GM] 22:26:19
owe $100 million at the end of it. So basically, you're selling it to him for $75 million, he's installing… the new drive for $100 million, and then when you get back.

[GM] 22:26:33
You'll have to just pay for the… the upgraded engine.

[Ink] 22:26:36
Okay, so he's taking our… our ship… ship for the $75 million on credit towards those engines, and…

[Dex Miro] 22:26:43
But we don't get $75 million now, then, do we?

[GM] 22:26:44
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:26:45
No, because it's still in the ship, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:26:47
Yeah

[GM] 22:26:50
Um, then the leasing portion is… Um… I'm not sure… leasing a ship cost.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:01
Okay, so we get nothing now when we come back from this mission and we pay $100 million to get the engine.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:08
And the ship back.

[GM] 22:27:09
Right. Um…

[Ink] 22:27:13
And he's gonna charge us per month once he gets it up and running.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:16
Yeah.

[GM] 22:27:17
Uh, he's in charge of per jump.

[Ink] 22:27:19
Or jump, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:22
Because every jump is a chance it explodes.

[GM] 22:27:25
Yeah, it's like wear and tear on the vehicle.

[GM] 22:27:31
I have to figure out how much a jump costs. I think it's $50,000.

[GM] 22:27:34
credits.

[Ink] 22:27:38
That's something we can pay when we get back.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:39
Okay. Is that… a thing that's on the ship that, like, fuel that we're using up.

[Ink] 22:27:40
They'll look at the odometer.

[GM] 22:27:40
Yeah.

[GM] 22:27:47
Uh, it's not just fuel. It's like… Um, you'll need to buy fuel, potentially, along the way.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:55
Okay.

[GM] 22:27:57
You're not sure based on this new tech. Uh, and where you need to go, if this will just get you right there or not.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:05
Is it… is it something that'll be relatively easy to find, though?

[GM] 22:28:09
like, fuel, or… Yeah, it's just standard jump fuel.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:10
the fuel. Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:14
Okay.

[Ink] 22:28:16
Can he make the shit present a little bit more exotic as well? Like, keep it that it's obviously a company ship, but make it look… experimental, so, like, when anybody questioned us, we're kind of like, we're some of the elite black ops.

[GM] 22:28:29
Yeah, he paints flames on the side of the ship.

[Ink] 22:28:32
Awesome, nobody will doubt us now.

[GM] 22:28:37
We're…

[Ink] 22:28:37
Yeah, I mean, like, they're like, hey, what are you doing? You're like, dudes, you don't even have clearance to know who the fuck we are.

[GM] 22:28:43
And we don't… we're so tough, we don't… we drive around with no weapons on our ship.

[Ink] 22:28:48
Because we're so fat. I mean, like, by the time you could shoot us, uh.

[Ink] 22:28:52
Now we're here to clean your androids out.

[GM] 22:28:58
Um… Okay, I don't know how much, uh, a jump is, I'll figure that out, and… As well as, like, fuel costs.

[GM] 22:29:05
But, uh, I'll do that later. Or maybe… At the… after the session's over.

[GM] 22:29:15
All right, you guys want to do some downtime?

[Ink] 22:29:17
Yeah.

[GM] 22:29:20
to sure leave. Alright, you party for months.

[GM] 22:29:26
However you wish to choose the party. Alright, whoever's participating in shore leave.

[GM] 22:29:32
Make a save… using the worst save.

[GM] 22:29:41
I have modified notes in here.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:49
in the worst save.

[GM] 22:29:50
Whatever your worst save is, make a save using that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:58
Failed that good.

[Ink] 22:30:02
Me too. Oh, nice. Better?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:30:05
I got it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:06
Wait, me too? my… my work… My worst save.

[GM] 22:30:07
Yeah. If you want to participate in…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:30:10
If you want to party, you want to party with us?

[GM] 22:30:14
Yeah. Failure is do not convert any stress, but relieve all stress, getting the character back to minimum stress.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:16
So what happens if we fail again?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:30:19
Hmm. I'm over.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:24
Okay. The norm stress is too.

[GM] 22:30:25
then you gain… Then you gain one for failing the save.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:30
Okay. Oh, I started at 3, so I'm still at 3.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:30:34
We build up all that potential leveling up, and we got zero.

[GM] 22:30:39
Uh-huh.

[Ink] 22:30:41
But what about… what about Carnoc?

[GM] 22:30:44
Uh, Carnoc let's see… Carnoc can convert, uh, on a success… Uh, some of the stress into improved saves, each port converts a different amount of stress, as shown on the table, whatever.

[GM] 22:30:57
Stress you don't convert is relieved. Um… I thought it was something about, like, the ones below. For every point of stress you convert, you can improve a save by 1.

[GM] 22:31:07
Oh, okay, so this is a… But I have this, uh, convert the ones amount. Okay.

[GM] 22:31:15
Uh, Carnoc can convert 9 points of stress if he has that much.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:31:20
Actually, I have two that I can convert.

[GM] 22:31:22
There you go.

[Ink] 22:31:37
So none of us still get to level up.

[GM] 22:31:41
Nope. do just improve your saves.

[Ink] 22:31:43
What is Level Up do anyway? You get, like, more skills, or… Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 22:31:49
to basically take… so now, Carnoc gets to take… and improve.

[GM] 22:31:54
any of his saves by 2, or he can put 1 into 1 and 1 into another.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:58
Damn it!

[GM] 22:32:01
Do you have a lot of stress? Yeah, you. You stressed out?

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:04
Who, me? I have

[GM] 22:32:10
Yeah, see? You're fine. Okay.

[GM] 22:32:17
Um, you guys party for a few months. Um… That could be a variety of ways.

[GM] 22:32:28
Sex, drugs, rock and roll. playing… playing, uh… keyboard jockey, or whatever the cowboy, uh… whatever Ingus… This is crew… Terminal jacket? What is it called? There's something? Terminal jack?

[GM] 22:32:45
I gotta figure out what they're called now. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:48
I play a game of D&D inside the game of Mothership.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:52
And…

[GM] 22:32:56
Um… Council Cowboy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:59
beat off a lid.

[GM] 22:33:01
Zeke becomes a council cowboy. He's floating around zero G, he's playing… playing D&D on his… zero-g computer.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:01
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:33:04
Capsule Cowboy.

[GM] 22:33:13
floating upside down, just… hacking away on the keys.

[GM] 22:33:19
Murderbot goes about… creating a Minecraft world in a slick world.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:26
what am I doing now?

[GM] 22:33:28
You want to show off your slip world to everybody, and it's just a bunch of penises made out of, like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:33:34
Not really. No, I'm good.

[GM] 22:33:34
blocks.

[GM] 22:33:40
Because you don't have one, that's why you're jealous of all these… All these dicks out there in the world.

[GM] 22:33:50
Um, okay. Loch comes to find you guys one day.

[GM] 22:33:57
and tells you that the ship is ready to go.

[GM] 22:34:02
Um… explains the… how to use it. Basically, you can travel.

[GM] 22:34:08
without any kind of risk. Um… Using a normal amount of fuel.

[GM] 22:34:17
Um… And then there's, you know, basically putting in an overdrive.

[GM] 22:34:24
Um.

[GM] 22:34:30
in… when you use the overdrive method, um… Not only does it use less fuel, uh, but it also allows you to jump further.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:34:41
Hmm.

[GM] 22:34:42
Um… Also, in the overdrive mode, you don't have to be jumping, uh, but you can basically just… burn jump fuel as part of… uh, your normal… Um, navigation.

[GM] 22:34:57
So let's see. It says…

[GM] 22:35:02
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:03
And what's the, uh, downside? Yeah.

[Ink] 22:35:06
Might blow up.

[GM] 22:35:08
Yeah. Engaging in either the, um… Efficient jumping?

[GM] 22:35:16
Method, um… Or, using Jump Fuel in normal navigation.

[GM] 22:35:21
has a risk associated with it.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:27
Oh, how significant of risk are we talking about?

[GM] 22:35:30
Um… Let's see… it's based on… this… based on the systems of your… of your ship.

[Ink] 22:35:34
Don't remember Level 6.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:39
Oh, no.

[GM] 22:35:42
So your systems are a 5. That's like having a… 5, or your, uh… like, strength or something?

[GM] 22:35:53
So, if you were using this. Um.

[GM] 22:35:59
You would have to roll under a 5 in order… In order to not take damage.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:05
Um, a V100.

[GM] 22:36:05
The ship doesn't… Yeah

[GM] 22:36:12
Your ship sucks bad.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:13
All right.

[GM] 22:36:18
Um, you don't instantly blow up, but, uh, your ship does take damage.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:24
I'm not sure how Dex ended up in the very flowery shirt there, but I don't mind it.

[Ink] 22:36:29
Oh, yeah, I had you change out of your orange jumpsuit that you usually wear for… Right? I told a Hawaiian themes, is what I thought.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:33
Yeah. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:36:38
So, I took a little liberty there.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:39
Yeah. Everybody else is the same as last wishing.

[Ink] 22:36:45
Well, Carter, he's all… he's all business.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:36:47
Yeah. I like how Murderbot is never wearing armor, but I'm always wearing armor.

[Ink] 22:36:54
He got downgraded, bro.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:55
it doesn't hurt me. I don't care if it…

[Ink] 22:37:01
he's inconspicuous.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:01
So, like, how much… how much damage are you thinking, like, could we blow up on our first jump?

[GM] 22:37:07
Um… no, probably not.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:07
Hmm…

[Ink] 22:37:10
So, we can ride the ship out normally until we need the super speed, right?

[GM] 22:37:15
Right.

[Ink] 22:37:16
Okay. And… And we may not… if we can try to, like… I kind of just scoot on by with our, uh.

[Ink] 22:37:24
you know, like, hey, we're supposed to be here. It might not be until somebody says.

[Ink] 22:37:28
hey, you're not supposed to be here that we don't hit the, you know, the little red button that… jumps. That's from super fast, or something like that, right?

[GM] 22:37:33
Right.

[Ink] 22:37:34
Okay, that's the plan. We just got this in our back pocket in case we need it.

[GM] 22:37:38
Right.

[Ink] 22:37:38
kind of like Murderbot's exploding button.

[GM] 22:37:45
Um, okay. Are there… is there anything else you guys want to do before you depart on your mission?

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:57
I don't think I can't… we can do… I can't… I can… I don't know if I can do anything.

[Ink] 22:37:58
Uh…

[Ink] 22:38:03
Nah, I think we're good.

[GM] 22:38:08
Okay. the coordinates and, uh… jump points… are downloaded into your system's, uh, ship system.

[GM] 22:38:19
So you got navigation to the, uh… the facility.

[GM] 22:38:28
Um… called CloudBank Synthetics Production Facility.

[GM] 22:38:33
Um, it'll take you two jumps to get there, but if you use the, uh… the jump drive would only take you one.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:44
I feel like we should say that for emergencies.

[GM] 22:38:48
Remember, it's like 50,000 credits a jump.

[Dex Miro] 22:38:52
Like, regular chumps, or emergency jumps?

[GM] 22:38:53
Yeah, for your lease. It's part of lease agreement, it's based on jumps.

[Ink] 22:39:03
I don't know, Carnoc's got some hot dice. You think you can roll a 4?

[Dex Miro] 22:39:07
No. I think we're saving it for emergencies.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:39:07
Uh… no.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:07
I think you can.

[Ink] 22:39:11
Okay… Boring life.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:16
50,000 is nothing what we're getting paid $350 million. If we blow up, we get nothing.

[Ink] 22:39:21
Okay, yeah, because we're… yeah, we don't have to pay that until we get back. If we don't come back, we have no money, we have nothing to pay for it anyway.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:26
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:27
But this is a fair point.

[Ink] 22:39:29
Okay. I just hate cryo-sleep.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:33
I do just want to see if Carnoc can roll a 4, though, I feel like…

[Dex Miro] 22:39:38
I mean, the ship's not gonna explode if we roll a 6. It just… gets worse as it gets higher, right? Maybe? I guess it probably doesn't.

[Ink] 22:39:46
Can we have… Can we have a MurderBot run up a simulation, and we'll press a virtual red button and have Carnoc roll and see if we would have made it?

[GM] 22:39:47
Um…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:39:58
It was simulated on the holo deck.

[GM] 22:39:58
Um…

[Ink] 22:40:00
Exactly. With his virtual pet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:40:03
Shimaru.

[GM] 22:40:04
We can… we can kind of… if you guys want to ret-con this, um… he… he could upgrade the ship's systems for $450,000 if someone wants to… front that cache.

[GM] 22:40:16
by plus 10. So you would go up to a 15 instead of a 5.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:22
I'll front it.

[GM] 22:40:23
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:23
I mean, that seems like a useful thing to do.

[Ink] 22:40:25
I'll go in on that, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:27
Yeah, I'll do 100,000.

[GM] 22:40:27
All right. As part…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:40:30
Yeah, sure, I can go on that, too.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:31
Wait, you said it was $74,000, no? Oh, 450,000? Jesus Christ.

[GM] 22:40:33
about 450,000.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:38
We've got a million apiece.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:40:38
All divide it by 5.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:40
What? What'd you say?

[Ink] 22:40:44
I put 90,000 apiece.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:40:45
Yeah, we have a 5, yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:45
Yeah, I know. Yes, I can do math.

[GM] 22:40:50
Alright. as the upgrade, then… that upgrade is a dedicated reactor.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:40:51
We do 90,000 apiece.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:52
The 90s, though, 100.

[GM] 22:40:59
So he… he adds a dedicated reactor to the… the jump drive, so that it isolates a little bit more of the… the risk about blowing up.

[GM] 22:41:16
Someone please make a note of the dedicated reactor so that when I ask you guys a role, I'm like, well, it says here a 5, you can be like, well, it's… It's actually a 15.

[GM] 22:41:28
Um, okay. Are you guys still gonna go for, uh… Just two jumps, then?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:41:36
Yeah, so…

[Ink] 22:41:37
I think that's funny, yeah.

[GM] 22:41:39
Alright. You put them in cryo sleep, Murderbot.

[GM] 22:41:44
There they are. The humans that you've been… you know, you've chosen to protect.

[GM] 22:41:49
They're just laying there, helpless little babies. Wouldn't it be so bad if, you know.

[GM] 22:41:55
Someone were to just eject one of these pods out into space.

[Ink] 22:41:59
You'd be lonely, Murderbot, you'd be lonely. Who's gonna carry you when your legs get ripped off?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:02
Hold on, hold

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:04
Yeah, we don't need all these people, uh, especially the one that

[GM] 22:42:11
There's such a drain on resources.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:11
Doing all the calculation in my head.

[GM] 22:42:20
Um, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:42:20
Just watch your shows, Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:22
All I do is sit next to Carnoc's pod, just staring at him.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:42:30
Hoping I don't talk in my sleep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:31
running calculations, should I, shouldn't I? Should I, shouldn't I?

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:35
Probability of success of… First, when I wake up, do I sh… Shut his mouth… keep his mouth closed so he cannot call.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:49
Kill switch.

[GM] 22:42:51
Um, alright. Months pass. Um… form one jump, uh, then you find a refilling station, I'll figure out how many.

[GM] 22:43:01
So that costs, and then… make another jump.

[GM] 22:43:08
about a week's time out from… the CloudBank Synthetics Production Facility.

[GM] 22:43:14
Um… Murderbot wakes you guys up.

[GM] 22:43:18
Everyone make a body save. Not Murderbot, though. Murderbot doesn't… he's not sleeping.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:24
I wanted to admit that body save.

[GM] 22:43:27
I mean, you can if you want, and then you fail it and get stressed.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:32
Ooh, I succeed this time.

[GM] 22:43:33
Look at you guys! Look at you guys. Um, not so much in Carnoc.

[GM] 22:43:40
Same with Zeke. just vomit. Aren't you getting tired of cleaning up all this vomit from these… mush bags?

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:51
Yes, it is very tedious.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:52
much big, so I like that. So it's… who has crossed at this time?

[GM] 22:43:56
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:43:59
Zeke, Carnoc.

[GM] 22:44:03
Yep. Um… A few days out, uh… you start getting pings from… uh, your… your, uh, wants to say, radar?

[GM] 22:44:21
whatever, deep comms. Um… there's a warning, it seems like it's automated trans… transmission.

[GM] 22:44:29
basically stating that, um, you're entering into. restricted.

[GM] 22:44:35
space, uh…

[GM] 22:44:46
But there's no… no, like, directive to, like. communicate back with them.

[GM] 22:44:52
Um. As you get a little bit closer, your sensors are able to determine that.

[GM] 22:44:58
Um, there's a significant… presence of… of ships.

[GM] 22:45:04
Um… basically, there are at least 3… Troop ships?

[GM] 22:45:11
Which, uh, in comparison to your ship, is like… Uh, their crews are on… the order of 100 or more?

[GM] 22:45:21
Uh, and the size of the ships are typically… what, 4 or 5 times bigger than your ship?

[GM] 22:45:28
Each one of them. Uh, you would not want to get into a firefight with them on account of having zero weapons on your ship.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:35
Right. They have guns.

[GM] 22:45:37
They have big guns.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:38
Oh my god.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:43
So they're actively moving around, they're…

[GM] 22:45:47
Um… the positioning of the ships, uh, also on your radar, or your sensors, you pick up the… the… uh, space facility, which is huge.

[GM] 22:45:59
I mean, it's not too much larger than, um, Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 22:46:04
But it's about the same size. Um, the ships seem to orbit around. They're not stationary, they do kind of, like, rotate.

[GM] 22:46:14
But they maintain a, um… sort of synchronous orbit.

[GM] 22:46:19
amongst themselves, so they're always just kind of, like, equidistant.

[GM] 22:46:23
Uh, but they are seemingly patrolling. Um… About a day out from… uh… the facility.

[GM] 22:46:36
you start getting regular comms now, um… and are hailed by one of the ships.

[GM] 22:46:42
This is Troop Ship Zhuangzi. Uh… report on call sign and manifest.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:46:58
We got one of those.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:03
I mean, we have a call sign? Are we telling them the actual call sign?

[GM] 22:47:11
Ink, you're muted.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:11
Nice bearded.

[Ink] 22:47:14
Um, do we have… we have the call sign that the ship was when it was part of the company?

[GM] 22:47:18
Yeah, you could have figured that out.

[Ink] 22:47:20
Yeah, so can we transmit that call sign? And… and Manifest is not our crew, that's… or is it our crew, or what's the…

[GM] 22:47:28
It's crew and, um, any kind of… major supplies that you're transporting.

[Ink] 22:47:34
Okay, so we got no major supplies. As far as we know, there's no record of us.

[Ink] 22:47:40
really going… the last thing we were was on a secret mission, right?

[GM] 22:47:44
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:47:47
So I say we just say who we are, as far as that we're on a… Here's who we are, we're on a… we're on a… a specific mission to clean up some androids.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:50
Yeah.

[GM] 22:47:58
Okay, so you transmit… more or less back, like, truthful information. This is the ship.

[GM] 22:48:04
Owned by the company, use that call sign. Uh, your manifest is essentially.

[GM] 22:48:10
each of you, and, you know, should be in the corporate database.

[GM] 22:48:16
Um… Yeah. Uh… you know, transmit a mission about.

[GM] 22:48:23
trying to remove synthetics. From the facility. Uh, alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:30
That last part might not be a thing we should have transmitted, but…

[GM] 22:48:35
Too late. You did it. Said, we're here to kill synthetics.

[GM] 22:48:43
Um… Uh… you are requested to dock with, um… The troop ship swing sea, um… when you're, uh… and they give you coordinates on a… per approach.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:07
What is the troop ship's name, GM, and I'm not quite catching it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:10
Zhuangzi.

[GM] 22:49:12
Z-H-U-A-N-G-Z-I. Might be Zhuangzi, but… sorry.

[Ink] 22:49:19
So, trying to make a run right now, we would just go to a space station that they're all next to, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:19
Zhuangzi.

[GM] 22:49:24
I mean, they have, uh, a pretty significant different distance between them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:32
Hold on, what was our story again? God damn it.

[GM] 22:49:32
Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:35
What the fuck are we doing?

[Dex Miro] 22:49:37
Why is Murder by reading a story, Jake?

[Ink] 22:49:40
It's just raining my bedtime story.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:43
what am I doing? Hold on. Where is this?

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:49
No, I'm not! I was just staring at… oh, okay, I'm reading you a story, I see. Okay, there we go, I'm next to Carnoc.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:54
I mean, you're… you're definitely, like, wiping the fog off of Carnage to make sure you can actually see him in all his glory.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:56
That face says everything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:04
You are the end of the beginning of me.

[Ink] 22:50:09
GM, so if we jumped right now, how long would we have on the station before one of those ships got to us?

[GM] 22:50:17
Um… Maybe a day.

[Ink] 22:50:21
Okay. And then we… then we could potentially jump out of there bef… as soon as they got there, and we'd be… We are, you know, way beyond them with the… shipped it, hopefully, is still in one piece.

[GM] 22:50:33
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:50:35
So that's one of our options. Once we dock, we can't jump, right?

[Ink] 22:50:40
Without… without power. damaging things.

[GM] 22:50:41
Um, I mean…

[GM] 22:50:46
Yeah, I mean, you couldn't… yeah, you'd have to disengage. You could jump pretty close to a ship, though.

[Ink] 22:50:57
maybe a day, and then that means that ships on top of us.

[Ink] 22:51:03
They're not gonna blow up the station.

[Ink] 22:51:10
The station's the size of Prospero Dream. So it's huge.

[GM] 22:51:12
Uh-huh. It's huge.

[GM] 22:51:21
There's also, um, on your sensors, you pick up.

[GM] 22:51:26
An object that is not that far from the station.

[GM] 22:51:30
Um, your sensors are unable to determine exactly what it is.

[GM] 22:51:33
Uh, but it seems to be orbiting the station, uh.

[GM] 22:51:37
you know, within a few hours' distance to the station.

[Ink] 22:51:44
potentially another ship that could get there a lot quicker.

[GM] 22:51:46
Yeah. No.

[Ink] 22:52:05
I don't know, can we talk our way through this to see the ship?

[Ink] 22:52:09
to get to the station without… Or otherwise, we have maybe a few hours at best, then, if that's a… if that's something that's closer.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:19
I mean… what are they gonna… I don't know, I'm not clear on what they're trying to check to allow us through.

[Ink] 22:52:28
I guess as long as they don't detain us, shoot us, our… a confiscate a ship or blow us up, or something like that.

[Ink] 22:52:34
they might just send this back on our way.

[Ink] 22:52:37
Right? And then we can try to run by them.

[Ink] 22:52:43
We just don't drink the apple juice this time.

[Ink] 22:52:54
So we can still try to, uh… talk our way through.

[Ink] 22:52:59
If that doesn't work, they just kick us back out.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:53:07
Alright, guys.

[Ink] 22:53:10
Zeke's sleeping.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:53:11
Almost. I'm just getting up for a second.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:15
And so we're… Like, are we just waiting for them to get closer? Are they actually going to talk with us and want to come aboard?

[Ink] 22:53:23
We've been ordered to dock, right? And then… We don't know from there, do we, right? They just want us to dock with them?

[GM] 22:53:29
Yep, yep.

[Ink] 22:53:34
And they might be just trying to validate our manifest.

[Ink] 22:53:39
Something like that, I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:44
So what's our actual story for being here?

[Dex Miro] 22:53:49
Like, we're trying to… the company wants to repurpose things from this installation or something like that.

[Ink] 22:53:58
My understanding is that the station is unusable because the androids are running amok in there.

[Ink] 22:54:05
And they're pretty much just… guarding it so nothing goes in and out.

[Ink] 22:54:10
That's what I got from Loshi.

[Ink] 22:54:15
Loshi, I don't know what's his name.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:18
I mean, I can… it kind of seems that way with the… ship that contacted us, I guess, but…

[GM] 22:54:18
I got that from Ingus.

[Ink] 22:54:25
Ingus, rather, Ingus.

[Ink] 22:54:34
Because they're… they're hanging pretty far away from it, huh?

[Dex Miro] 22:54:39
over there? I wasn't clear how far away the trip shifts were from the station.

[Ink] 22:54:42
It's gonna take those… the ships that were… uncovering now are a day away from the station.

[Ink] 22:54:49
They're keeping their distance to a certain extent. We're right by them about the dock, right, GM?

[Dex Miro] 22:54:49
Okay. How far are we away from them, though?

[GM] 22:54:57
Uh… I mean, you can… have up to a day's worth of distance if you want.

[Ink] 22:55:03
Oh, okay, gotcha. So we might be two days by normal travel to the station, 1 day from the… this.

[Ink] 22:55:08
barricade.

[GM] 22:55:09
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:10
Okay.

[Ink] 22:55:24
And we can't identify that object that's close to the station in orbit about 3 or 4 hours out.

[Ink] 22:55:31
away from the station.

[GM] 22:55:33
Your sensors aren't good enough to identify it yet.

[GM] 22:55:35
You get closer. You know, you might be able to figure it out.

[Ink] 22:55:40
How close would we have to get to be able to see it?

[GM] 22:55:42
Um, maybe a day, or… A little less?

[Ink] 22:55:46
Okay, so potentially before we get to the ship barricade, we might be able to identify what that is.

[GM] 22:55:51
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:55:53
And we could still jump right next to the ship.

[GM] 22:55:57
Yes.

[Ink] 22:55:58
And when we have control of the docking, like, as far as we could decouple as soon as we wanted to?

[GM] 22:56:07
Um, assuming that you're… you have access to the… controls to be able to detach ourselves.

[Ink] 22:56:13
Oh, okay, between your elite hacker.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:19
That's gonna get out the fingers.

[Ink] 22:56:21
That's right

[Ink] 22:56:22
That's the magic fingers.

[Ink] 22:56:43
Um, well, I guess I'm up for continued to… to proceed towards the company ship, and try to scan what's close to the station.

[Ink] 22:56:51
And observe anything else that's going on. If anybody goes in or out of there.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:59
Yeah, I mean, so… is the best story that we're just here to inventory?

[Dex Miro] 22:57:05
the resources that the company can recoup, and then once we do that, we're out of here.

[Ink] 22:57:09
We might even say we're set to retrieve something from the station. I don't know, we already told them we're here to.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:09
Or something like that.

[Ink] 22:57:15
clean up some Android mess, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:57:19
Yeah, well… Maybe not the best phrase if they're all androids, but…

[Ink] 22:57:24
We think that the whole, uh… yeah, but it's different androids. There's the Androids that are running amok on the station, right? And that's why nobody can get in there.

[Ink] 22:57:52
I'm all for just getting closer to the company ship with maybe the intention of docking… with them, see if we can't talk through this, but I'm open to other people's…

[Dex Miro] 22:58:00
Yeah, I mean, as long as we're convinced we can just… Push off the decking, and then use our… fancy engine in case of emergency. I'm on board with that.

[Ink] 22:58:10
Yeah, and so that… the only thing that depends there is if we can hack our… to decouple if we need to in emergency.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:15
Murderbot…

[Ink] 22:58:17
Nearby.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:18
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:21
You're a hacker if we need one.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:24
What am I hacking again?

[Dex Miro] 22:58:25
I mean… the Android chip to make sure it doesn't bother us if we have to.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:32
Okay. I will be using…

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:39
Wait, I'm jacking into a tournament? I gotta jacket into a terminal.

[Ink] 22:58:41
Not yet. Not yet. You don't you yet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:43
Okay. I will keep the dice warm and ready.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:55
I also have a psionic attack that overloads targeted electronics!

[Ink] 22:59:00
Me too.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:00
I don't know if that works on entire enemy spaceships, but it could be wrong.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:03
I downloaded my consciousness into everything?

[Dex Miro] 22:59:07
Oh, no, no, you are the ship.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:09
I am the chef. I am… the Murderbot.

[GM] 22:59:18
Um, so you guys are planning to dock with the ship, then?

[Dex Miro] 22:59:21
I guess so. Weird. We are watching cautiously, but yes.

[Ink] 22:59:21
I think we're gonna make it look like we are intending to do that, and that's our current… plan.

[GM] 22:59:25
Okay. Alright, um… you're… you get to within a day of the station, you're very close, uh, to the troop ship.

[GM] 22:59:38
that you were… told to dock with, um, your sensors are able to determine that the, um.

[GM] 22:59:46
the object that's floating near the station is an A… thruster… Uh, which is… proportionally, like, 10 times larger than your ship.

[GM] 23:00:00
Uh, and that you… basically put together that that thruster was, at one point.

[GM] 23:00:06
a part of the facility. So the facility used to be able to… have, like, navigation and be able to move.

[GM] 23:00:14
Uh, but it no longer does.

[Ink] 23:00:19
And it's, uh, so it's… its orbit is… is not artificial right now. It's actually a gravitational orbit.

[GM] 23:00:26
Yeah, presumably.

[Ink] 23:00:27
Okay, so it's… it's not on its own propulsion.

[GM] 23:00:31
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:41
I look tired.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:00:42
Yep, I'll sign off in a few minutes.

[GM] 23:00:45
Yeah, we're almost at a good wrapping up point.

[Ink] 23:00:47
Yeah, so maybe another storyline is that we can, uh, we were gonna fix the… the thruster. I don't know.

[Ink] 23:00:54
I'm curious to see what these people… you're going to say about this?

[Dex Miro] 23:00:55
Well. It's… it's unclear if all these people are on the same side or not at this point.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:02
Like, maybe they're trying to… keep things away from the station, and also are themselves staying away from the station.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:09
We'll see how this goes.

[Ink] 23:01:15
Will we be able to tow the thruster back to the station, GM?

[GM] 23:01:19
Um, I mean, maybe? Probably?

[Ink] 23:01:24
We are equipped with a tractor beam, right? Then we can just nudge it back.

[GM] 23:01:26
Mm-mm.

[GM] 23:01:34
I mean, it's deep space, like, you can… Hook some cables to it, and probably any object could… move it into orbit.

[GM] 23:01:42
getting into position and stuff just right might be pretty difficult.

[GM] 23:01:46
You don't think that your ship is the kind of ship that's designed to do that kind of work, though?

[Ink] 23:01:50
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:53
Our ship isn't designed to do anything.

[GM] 23:01:57
It's designed to move real fast now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:58
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:59
True.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:07
Alright, so…

[Dex Miro] 23:02:11
I guess let's talk and talk to these guys.

[Ink] 23:02:20
Yeah. We got some good information, at least.

[GM] 23:02:20
Yeah.

[GM] 23:02:24
Okay. Um, your ship… docking procedures, you align and match speed with the, uh… troop ship… Um… your, uh… That's not, like, docking at the space station where, like, there's, like.

[GM] 23:02:46
um… a procedure, you're kind of just, like, on their ship all of a sudden, and… you know, there's not… doesn't seem to be any kind of, um… process of, like, sanitization or anything like that. Instead, um…

[GM] 23:03:01
you're greeted at your docking door. by… what?

[GM] 23:03:09
4… 4 heavily armed, um… people, they're wearing all black.

[GM] 23:03:17
Um, 3 of them are heavily armored. And they have helmets on that… You can't see the upper half of their faces or their hair. The helmet covers all that.

[GM] 23:03:27
Instead, they have these sort of visors that are red.

[GM] 23:03:30
And they kind of, like, flash back and forth.

[GM] 23:03:34
Um, kind of like the old… The old Cylons, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:35
Uh, allowance?

[GM] 23:03:37
Um, but the… but the bottom half of their helmets are open, or, like, they're… You can see their mouths, um… Necks, chins, you know, they're definitely humans.

[GM] 23:03:48
Um… Uh, they're… they're… while heavily armed, they… don't… they don't… aren't, like… aiming their weapons at you, um… the… there's a woman in the front, and she greets you and says.

[GM] 23:04:04
My name's Commander Rachel Kilroy. I'm in charge of the troubleshooters here.

[GM] 23:04:10
Are you the next troubleshooting team to… to take a shot at the deep.

[Ink] 23:04:16
That's us! Any information you have to assist us on our… Our shot would be awesome.

[GM] 23:04:18
Good.

[GM] 23:04:24
Good. Uh, follow me, we'll go to the debriefing room.

[GM] 23:04:29
Um… She leads you guys, uh, through the ship, um… Pretty standard corporate ship, uh, although they're… Um, those people that you see are often in military fatigues, um.

[GM] 23:04:46
So unlike the… the corporate ship you came from, where there's, like.

[GM] 23:04:50
a lot more civilian-type. Uh, people, there's a lot more military.

[GM] 23:04:56
Um, almost everyone's wearing black. Um… the, uh, security detail that's with her breaks off at some point, and you're just following her through the ship.

[GM] 23:05:09
Um, you get to… Uh, the debriefing room.

[GM] 23:05:13
You enter into it, she closes the door, um… lights up, uh, essentially, uh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:17
Hmm…

[GM] 23:05:21
digital image of the… It's three-dimensional, um… of the facility.

[GM] 23:05:28
Um, she takes off her helmet. Um… she's… blonde-haired, long, about shoulder length.

[GM] 23:05:37
Or no, a little bit longer than shoulder length.

[GM] 23:05:40
Um, she's probably in her early 40s. Um, just got a couple of, like.

[GM] 23:05:48
small scars, probably shrapnel wounds of some sort. Um.

[GM] 23:05:54
And she has, like, just sort of deep, serious eyes.

[GM] 23:05:57
She's like… I'm on my third tour here at The Deep.

[GM] 23:06:04
Um, been… commanding officer of the Troubleshooters.

[GM] 23:06:08
And, uh… I… I take no risks, and I take no bullshit.

[GM] 23:06:14
So, let's cut to it. Um, she basically lays out what's been… Going on

[GM] 23:06:22
the facility, which he keeps referring to as the Deep.

[GM] 23:06:26
Um, when on, uh… went offline.

[GM] 23:06:31
Uh, a few years ago. And, um… as far as they can tell, the entire crew's been killed, and the androids have taken over.

[GM] 23:06:40
the, um… main thrust of this probably comes from an AI that was in development called Monarch.

[GM] 23:06:48
Um, and the corporation has now asked. for, um, her troubleshooters to basically take.

[GM] 23:06:58
re-control of the, um, facility. with as minimal damage to the facility as possible, including Monarch.

[GM] 23:07:08
Um… However, this isn't as straightforward as just going in guns blazing.

[GM] 23:07:15
Um, every team she has sent in, uh, has… has not returned, or when they return.

[GM] 23:07:23
They are not themselves. Um, the facility has the ability to print androids that mimic exactly.

[GM] 23:07:32
Exactly. Um, the people that they replace. And so they call these infiltrator androids.

[GM] 23:07:42
Um, the reason they're in this sort of patrol mechanism is that.

[GM] 23:07:45
After having found out that these infiltrators were trying to get off ship.

[GM] 23:07:50
Uh, they now have a strict policy of, uh, basically no one comes in or out.

[GM] 23:07:54
Except for specific teams. And those teams, when they return, are… Subject to high scrutiny of trying to figure out if they're androids or not.

[GM] 23:08:07
Um.

[GM] 23:08:11
There have also been rumors of… Um, artifacts?

[GM] 23:08:17
that have been found, uh… So there have been, um… rumors that have floated out into nearby space, uh, attracting all sorts of… Um, we'll say the archaeologists.

[GM] 23:08:33
They're looking for these artifacts, um… you know, mostly treasure hunters.

[GM] 23:08:40
They're basically looking to… find these artifacts, get out of there, and sell those off. So, occasionally, they'll have runners of the blockade.

[GM] 23:08:47
Uh, they're trying to dock with the ship. they've been given orders to basically shoot down any ship, um.

[GM] 23:08:54
coming or leaving. And so far, they've been mostly successful.

[GM] 23:09:00
Um… main concern is that not, you know, the… Essentially, these infiltrator androids getting off ship and running amok somewhere else in the galaxy.

[GM] 23:09:11
But for the most part, they feel pretty secure in having done this.

[GM] 23:09:16
Um… So… That's the debrief.

[GM] 23:09:26
Um, she assumes that you're basically a new troubleshooter crew that's gonna go.

[GM] 23:09:31
load onto the deep, and then… Uh, try to… try to basically, uh, secure the, uh.

[GM] 23:09:38
the ship.

[Ink] 23:09:45
That's what we've been told. Uh, any other, I guess, intel that anybody may be able to bring back as far as that.

[Ink] 23:09:50
we might not have got to help. with the, uh… security of the ship, I guess, or the systems on it.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:00
Is there any way we can stop them from turning us into the infiltrators?

[GM] 23:10:07
Um…

[Ink] 23:10:08
Sounds like they just kill you and then make a robot out of you, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:11
Yeah. So, don't die. Good plan, yeah.

[GM] 23:10:16
Uh, they don't even have to kill you, as far as I can tell.

[Ink] 23:10:18
Yeah, who knows what they do with you.

[GM] 23:10:22
Um… We do have, uh, some tech here to be able to detect androids.

[GM] 23:10:30
Um, but it seems like the, uh… the androids are evolving over there.

[GM] 23:10:37
It's becoming harder and harder to tell which ones are androids and which ones are real people.

[GM] 23:10:44
Um… Did I say that nobody's ever gotten out of there alive?

[GM] 23:10:49
That's not… that's not entirely true. Um… I've… I've… I've gotten out of there.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:49
Yeah.

[GM] 23:10:57
And I know a few other people.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:58
What?

[Dex Miro] 23:11:03
Are all of you are on the ship? Like, how'd you… How did you make it out?

[GM] 23:11:06
Um…

[GM] 23:11:13
Um. This was early on, um… My team went in, uh… We thought that some of the crew was still alive.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:13
This person is an android.

[GM] 23:11:25
Uh, but we were ambushed. we're able to firefight our way back to the ship and get off in time.

[GM] 23:11:33
Um… Yeah, been here ever since.

[GM] 23:11:40
Um… this… I think this facility… maybe is, like, threatens… all of human existence. I think that that AI is probably… I don't know, if some part of it gets off the ship, the ability for it to replicate itself and…

[GM] 23:11:56
I don't know, replicate humans? without any kind of discernible, or at least externally discernible.

[GM] 23:12:05
um… qualities… I mean, I can't even fathom what could be… what could happen in this universe.

[GM] 23:12:30
I guess that's where we'll stop. Because I kind of stunned you all in the silence, apparently.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:36
Yeah. I mean… It seems very high stakes.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:38
We'll save you… I mean, everyone.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:43
And write a song about me for nothing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:44
I'm not showing up for this!

[Dex Miro] 23:12:49
I mean, saying if you mess up and let them get out, they'll take over the whole universe.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:55
Seems kind of… yes.

[Ink] 23:12:56
So let's… let's bring them the fastest ship in the universe.

[GM] 23:13:01
And let's bring him the fastest show. But…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:13:01
Right, yeah. I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:02
Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, um, probably shouldn't have done that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:13:04
No problem.

[GM] 23:13:08
But just don't tell them that the red button is bad, that this shouldn't push it, because they'll just blow themselves up.
