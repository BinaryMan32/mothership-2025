[GM] 21:23:48
Right, right. Um… ink falls into the… The.

[GM] 21:23:58
Vending machine. Get some snacks, um… I don't remember there being that much graffiti on the elevator access thing. I think it… I pictured it more of, like.

[GM] 21:24:45
Yeah, probably. Uh… alright, 55B… Where are you guys going?

[Dex Miro] 21:24:53
I didn't know what these last few rooms were called.

[GM] 21:24:59
You mentioned the comms… room, it's the control room.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:03
They all seem, like, pretty similar with a bunch of server computer equipment racks and things.

[GM] 21:25:05
Oh, I see. Right, then you took the elevator up… Right, and you stopped off at… Um… Is this… Yes, you took the elevator up to 54A.

[GM] 21:25:22
Which was Lobby. Do you need me to tell you what 55B is called? 55b is called… Um…

[Ink] 21:25:25
Well, that's the lobby.

[GM] 21:25:36
uh, observation room.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:41
This is starting to seem much more like an experimental depth kind of thing.

[GM] 21:25:47
Um… Yep, and then 55C is experimentation room.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:48
55B was the observation room.

[GM] 21:25:55
Did you… you guys didn't go into those rooms, though.

[Dex Miro] 21:25:58
Didn't we?

[GM] 21:25:59
No, you were into 54B and 54. 55A.

[Ink] 21:26:05
We went to the north ones, right?

[GM] 21:26:06
Yeah, yeah, 55B and 55C are on the south side.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:10
Okay. I think I got some of the numbers wrong.

[GM] 21:26:11
So, 50… Yeah. 54b, which is where the ghost guy was at.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:20
Okay, that one I have, right? So we… where did we go into before 54B?

[GM] 21:26:20
Um, came out…

[GM] 21:26:26
Uh, before 54B, you were down… the elevator in the 57A, the elevator landing.

[GM] 21:26:35
Which, it looks like you have that, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:26:36
Oh. Yeah, but then after the elevator, there was the clinical break room.

[GM] 21:26:42
You know, lobby, yeah, and then… Yeah, I don't know.

[GM] 21:26:51
Yeah, I don't know why you have those labeled as 55.

[Dex Miro] 21:26:53
Okay, so that was all in 54B.

[GM] 21:26:53
you know, the… Yeah, I can… the 54B description is… Uh, Darkness, immense towers shrouded in gently drifting plastic crap, smells of organic rot.

[GM] 21:27:06
Uh, 4 6 meter tall towers wrapped in plastic.

[GM] 21:27:10
decommission stamped all over them. And then 55A… is hollowed out server racks like half-run, beached whales, narrow metal piping betwixt.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:13
Okay.

[GM] 21:27:23
lingering smell of burnt circuits and industrial grease. Um… you did go in there, and you heard some noise, and then you decided to leave.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:26
But we went in there, or we didn't. Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:33
Okay.

[GM] 21:27:34
Um… And then… we went back in the other room, can't remember why.

[GM] 21:27:41
I think, uh, um, what? Inc. Was supposed to be doing something.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:47
So what was 55A?

[GM] 21:27:47
You guys were gonna… going back into 54B. Um… Oh, you're setting up your transmitter in there.

[Ink] 21:27:59
Yeah, exactly, we went back to set the transmitter up.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:59
Yeah.

[GM] 21:28:03
Right. And then the guy showed up. And… stabbed you.

[GM] 21:28:10
Inc. Ink is not once succeeded yet on his, uh, whatchamacallit?

[Ink] 21:28:14
Uh, my EMP thing.

[GM] 21:28:14
Right. Yeah, he's just… he's just… Keeps it.

[Ink] 21:28:19
fails over and over again.

[GM] 21:28:21
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:28:21
It seems very unfair that the ghost guy could attack us, and we can't attack him, but… Yeah.

[GM] 21:28:27
Yeah, it's pretty unfair. Um… Murder bot threw his purple thing through, uh… Alright, go just having a grand old time shooting her gun at the ceiling.

[Dex Miro] 21:28:39
Yeah.

[GM] 21:28:41
Um… Then, at the end, some children ran out of 55A, and they were pounding on the door to get into 55D.

[GM] 21:28:50
They said, we want to go back to. That's where we… that's where we ended.

[Dex Miro] 21:28:58
Okay, so we… what I was calling… 55BNC were both actually.

[Dex Miro] 21:29:06
55A.

[GM] 21:29:08
And 54B.

[Dex Miro] 21:29:11
Right, we went in there afterwards, but I think I would just merge together…

[Dex Miro] 21:29:19
Okay, so what is 55A called?

[GM] 21:29:24
55A is called… simulation suite.

[GM] 21:29:29
financial simulation suite.

[Dex Miro] 21:29:32
Sounds like a place where they might develop an economic model.

[GM] 21:29:35
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 21:30:19
And believe that. One of the children was holding, like, 3 little black marbles, maybe? Might have seen.

[Ink] 21:30:57
We felt like the door, um, that the children want to get through is potentially go to outer space.

[GM] 21:31:06
Not according to your map.

[Ink] 21:31:08
Not according to my map, but you said, from our observations we were concerned, or no?

[GM] 21:31:16
No, it does have, like, an airlock door, but it's not… there's no other indicators that would be venting out to space.

[Ink] 21:31:19
Okay.

[Ink] 21:31:27
And there's… they're still pounding on it now?

[GM] 21:31:33
After a little while, they kind of just stop and look at you scared.

[Ink] 21:31:40
And one of them has 3 marbles.

[GM] 21:31:43
Three black marbles.

[Ink] 21:31:45
And those are worth, like, a billion credits apiece, right? So I need to have.

[Ink] 21:31:48
The kids gave me those marbles in exchange for opening the door.

[GM] 21:31:54
Is that what you offer?

[Ink] 21:31:57
Um, yeah, why not?

[GM] 21:32:02
Um…

[GM] 21:32:08
I was like… but I like these marbles. What if I just give you one?

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:12
All three, or you die!

[Ink] 21:32:13
Okay. Shut up, everybody. Alright, give him life.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:17
Okay!

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:19
well-functioning.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:22
shutting down.

[Ink] 21:32:23
Okay, I'll open… I'll try to open the door for one marble.

[Ink] 21:32:28
Can I go try to open that door?

[GM] 21:32:29
Yeah, um, the door is locked, like most other doors.

[Ink] 21:32:34
Oh, that's a good thing I… I brought my key that burns down sheds.

[GM] 21:32:34
Like this. Yep.

[Ink] 21:32:39
All right, while I pull out my key, I guess.

[GM] 21:32:41
Okay. Um… begin cutting through the lock.

[GM] 21:32:46
It doesn't take you much time, but you get through it.

[GM] 21:32:51
Um… They kind of cheer as they see you kind of pulling the doors apart, tying them apart a little bit.

[GM] 21:33:00
Um… As soon as you open the doors, you hear this audible drone.

[GM] 21:33:07
Um, kind of like, uh… like a server room with, like, um… Bunch of… fans and things going, it's just kind of like a… it's not, like, high-pitched or anything, it's just, like, kind of like, uh…

[GM] 21:33:22
Just, like, electronics. Functioning kind of thing.

[GM] 21:33:27
Um… Uh, as you open the door further.

[GM] 21:33:34
Um… you see data dancing across oceans of screens.

[GM] 21:33:40
This room is… not human scale, it's very large.

[GM] 21:33:47
Um… hanging from the wall are 8 camera-studded sensor homes with opaque visors.

[GM] 21:33:59
Um…

[Ink] 21:33:59
Like the one… like the ones we saw out in the, uh, the lobby there.

[GM] 21:34:04
Um, I don't think so. What was in the lobby?

[Ink] 21:34:08
We had a… we had camera homes, I thought as well out there.

[GM] 21:34:14
The lobby description says rime covering once clinical break area.

[GM] 21:34:20
Um, low bar with… low bars with stools. functional coffee machine, long-stale snack packets.

[GM] 21:34:29
Um… You might be thinking of, like, the headset from the comms room?

[Ink] 21:34:35
Uh, no, but that's okay.

[GM] 21:34:38
Anyways, these look like, like, VR helmets, basically. Um… Then there's a ring of 20 dust-coated.

[Ink] 21:34:43
Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 21:34:53
children, like, there's actually dust built up on these children.

[GM] 21:34:57
With thick cables sprouting from the base of their skulls.

[Ink] 21:35:03
like, matrix children?

[GM] 21:35:04
Um… Um, yeah, basically.

[GM] 21:35:08
Uh, you know, they don't… They don't seem to be, um… having any kind of, like… uh, physical sensation, like, they all just kind of are… sitting there as if, um…

[GM] 21:35:22
They were just shut down or something?

[GM] 21:35:28
Um…

[Ink] 21:35:28
Oh, so we're thinking, you know, like, Android-ish?

[GM] 21:35:33
Given that they have cable sprouting on their skulls, they're either modified like you guys.

[GM] 21:35:39
Or they're androids. The, um… there are also 20 workbenches with.

[GM] 21:35:46
Children behind each. Above the workbenches, there are.

[GM] 21:35:51
there's, like, a big screen. It displays complex engineering problems.

[GM] 21:35:57
Uh, the children are attempting to construct a solution to the problem, uh, using their hands.

[GM] 21:36:04
Uh, to blur over various tools and materials. They do not pay attention to you.

[Ink] 21:36:09
Oh, so they're moving.

[GM] 21:36:11
Yeah, those children are moving.

[GM] 21:36:15
Um, then there's, uh, 20 glass spheres floating in 0G.

[GM] 21:36:21
I guess for NZ. Gino.

[GM] 21:36:25
Um… That's not in the description of this game.

[GM] 21:36:31
Um… the glass spheres are opaque. Uh, with… it's not like they've been, like, painted, or, like, the material is opaque, it's that they have.

[GM] 21:36:42
mathematical formulae written all around them in so much density as to make it opaque.

[GM] 21:36:50
Um, the writing, you can tell, I guess. From the way you view it, is… on the inside, so somebody inside the thing must have written the.

[GM] 21:37:01
mathematical formulae. And then, uh, there's a… A facsimile of a middle-class family lounge.

[GM] 21:37:13
Behind one-way glass. So you see, like, a, um… chair, like a sofa chair, like a.

[GM] 21:37:21
lounge. Um, there's probably, like, a TV that's not on.

[GM] 21:37:26
Um… There's LAMP, telephone.

[GM] 21:37:30
Just, like, really trying to construct, like, uh… You know, a family… family living room kind of thing.

[GM] 21:37:39
Um… Uh, adjacent to that is another room.

[GM] 21:37:46
That has a bunch of cameras in it, and sensors.

[GM] 21:37:50
That, um… be… seem to be biometric sensors.

[GM] 21:37:55
So, reactions, um… With regards to eye movement… Body heat, that kind of stuff.

[GM] 21:38:05
currently in the… on the side. With the, uh, in the family room side.

[GM] 21:38:11
There's a child sitting with two adults. Um…

[GM] 21:38:22
And they seem to be pretend eating? like, there's, like, food, but it's not actually real food.

[GM] 21:38:31
All these things are happening in this room. They're, like, kind of… put in various different, uh… Uh, spaces.

[GM] 21:38:41
The two children that you… helped, who, I guess… Uh, you now have a black marble.

[GM] 21:38:51
Um… Which one did they join?

[GM] 21:38:58
Hmm… I think they probably join…

[GM] 21:39:09
the… the children… who are dust-covered. They probably go and, uh… Join them. So they run up and they… plug cables in the back of their brains, and they basically look like they shut down.

[Ink] 21:39:41
when they gave me the marble, did I have any physical contact with them?

[GM] 21:39:46
I mean, you can if you wanted to. They, you know, you could either… if you didn't want to, you could have, like, hold out your hand, then it gets dropped into your hand, or you could, like.

[GM] 21:39:55
Kind of, like, almost, like, clasp their hand for it, yeah.

[Ink] 21:39:59
I guess, yeah, just, I kind of want to know if there, if it's like a hologram like the other guy, or… if there was…

[GM] 21:40:03
Nope, they definitely… you can tell that there's some physicality to them.

[Ink] 21:40:09
I didn't do that in a creepy way, if anybody was noticing it.

[Ink] 21:40:13
Touching the children.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:14
But there could still be androids, they could even not know that they're androids.

[Ink] 21:40:19
Yeah. I just was wondering if we were looking at hologram… of course, they're carrying these blue marbles, which I assume I'm holding onto now, and… feel very real, right? Or I have one marble loose.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:29
Is it just a marble, or is it… Some technology thing.

[Ink] 21:40:33
I'm feeling power surge through me, and, you know…

[GM] 21:40:36
Yeah. Nope, um… you look at the marble, and… It is not of any material.

[GM] 21:40:45
That you can tell what it is.

[Ink] 21:40:50
Okay, so I'm just gonna dash that. For now, I guess, and uh… So, like, the kids are now pretty much asleep.

[Ink] 21:40:58
Check in.

[GM] 21:40:58
Yeah. Uh… seeing them in the state, you think you probably could go steal the other two marbles.

[Ink] 21:41:06
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, um, you know, one of them's worth a billion credits already, I don't need to get greedy.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:09
stealing toys from children.

[Ink] 21:41:17
I won't speak for Zeke, I'll turn the other way if Zeke wants to do something.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:20
But why did we think they're worth a billion credits here to say that, right?

[Ink] 21:41:23
I'm just saying that. I say enough, GM will believe it's the…

[Dex Miro] 21:41:26
Yeah. Um… I mean, if they're gonna completely ignore us.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:41:29
Ah.

[Dex Miro] 21:41:34
Could we use the Android scanner?

[GM] 21:41:39
on the children that just went and plugged themselves in?

[Dex Miro] 21:41:42
Yeah, I mean, it takes, like, a whole 20 minutes to scan one… Person, right?

[GM] 21:41:46
Yep.

[Ink] 21:41:47
And so if we find that their androids, have we learned anything?

[Ink] 21:41:52
I guess the risk is what I'm worried about.

[Ink] 21:41:57
Are we gonna piss off Monarch if we're scanning his children?

[Ink] 21:41:59
Does he care? I don't know.

[Ink] 21:42:04
I'll watch you as you do it.

[GM] 21:42:08
You wanna try scanning one?

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:14
I'll scan it.

[GM] 21:42:16
Alright. Murderbot brings over the scanner. It takes his time to, like, make sure to cover the entire child's body by.

[GM] 21:42:26
You know, kind of… I imagine it has sort of, like, a wand.

[GM] 21:42:30
Like, how when they… you scan for, uh… Someone carrying a weapon or something.

[GM] 21:42:34
only have to move really slowly, so you don't miss.

[GM] 21:42:37
That sort of, like, indicator that they're an Android.

[GM] 21:42:43
So, Murderbot's scanning the, uh… One of the children.

[GM] 21:42:47
And then suddenly… over in the living room scenario.

[GM] 21:42:55
one of the adults just starts screaming.

[GM] 21:43:02
And picks up a fork. Um… just… he's just screaming.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:04
Wait, what was you screaming? You, like…

[Dex Miro] 21:43:07
fix up.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:09
Oh, just like…

[GM] 21:43:12
picks up a fork, and then… stabs the, uh, other adult.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:13
Yeah.

[GM] 21:43:18
With the fork. Um… And the, uh, the child begins to cry.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:19
What? What?!

[Ink] 21:43:28
And this is, like, in a domestic scene, like a living room, or what was that scene?

[Dex Miro] 21:43:32
Yeah.

[GM] 21:43:32
Yeah. Um, shortly after, like, within a minute.

[GM] 21:43:42
Uh, you see two obvious androids, like, they don't have, like… the facsimile of, like, faces or anything, they look kind of like robots, but they're humanoid.

[GM] 21:43:52
Um, you didn't notice them at first, but then when you start to look around, there's actually a couple of them.

[GM] 21:43:57
Um, they come over. They have, uh, weapons, they have, uh, SMGs.

[GM] 21:44:05
They come over to the crying child. They put the SMG against the child's head.

[GM] 21:44:12
And then they pulled the trigger.

[Ink] 21:44:17
And the child gets his bullet through. They get shot?

[GM] 21:44:20
What's that? Yep.

[Ink] 21:44:25
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:26
Oh, these are terrible people. That aren't people, I guess.

[GM] 21:44:31
the, uh, the adults, uh, and the… Um… living room.

[GM] 21:44:38
situation, or whatever, uh, kitchenette, I don't know. They, uh, they stop screaming, they kind of go back into their places, and then… Um… one of the child… children from the, uh… I was working on the, uh.

[GM] 21:44:53
engineering problem. stops working on it and walks over, and the scene kind of resumes.

[GM] 21:45:00
One of the, uh, security androids picks up the.

[GM] 21:45:03
child that was shot, and then walks. past you guys out of the room.

[GM] 21:45:08
Uh, you can see it from where you're sort of standing, is standing at the elevator, waiting for the elevator to pick it up.

[Ink] 21:45:16
Oh, so they went out the door, and then we kind of.

[Ink] 21:45:18
quote-unquote, unlocked. human emulation. That's what we know those places.

[GM] 21:45:20
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:24
And nobody cares that we're here.

[Ink] 21:45:28
And it has to be having a pork.

[GM] 21:45:29
Doesn't… yeah. Um, Murderbot, uh, Murderbot finishes his scan.

[GM] 21:45:37
And determines that this is indeed an Android child.

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:40
They're fucking androids, man!

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:44
They're just like me, cocktail me!

[GM] 21:45:46
I was gonna say, it's just like you.

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:47
I thought I was the only one!

[GM] 21:45:51
It's not…

[Ink] 21:45:55
I'm not special.

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:59
Yo, what's going on with those people over there?

[Ink] 21:46:08
Um, well, I think I'm ready to leave this room.

[Ink] 21:46:15
Don't know that I feel like we're gonna learn much more.

[Ink] 21:46:20
Here.

[Ink] 21:46:27
Alright, we didn't go down through 55B and 55C.

[GM] 21:46:32
You have not yet gone there.

[Ink] 21:46:33
Okay. Can I go check those out now? So we've seen the entirety of this room, you said there's a… really large room, right?

[GM] 21:46:37
Sure. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:46:44
Okay.

[GM] 21:46:45
Yeah, you've seen pretty much all of the different.

[GM] 21:46:47
Yeah, scenarios.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:49
Is there any way for us to see what… For the kids with the cables plugged into them are seeing.

[GM] 21:46:58
Yeah, they're… you assume that the, uh… essentially VR homes that are on the wall.

[GM] 21:47:07
Probably can get a view of what they're… They're experiencing.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:12
Oh, like, the 8 more that aren't… So those sensor domes weren't hooked up to anything.

[GM] 21:47:19
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:22
Okay. Oh.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:27
I guess, could I try looking at one of those and see what's happening?

[GM] 21:47:30
like, putting it on? Okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:32
Yeah.

[GM] 21:47:36
Um, you put on the helmet. Uh… what you end up seeing is that these… These children are in a death match.

[GM] 21:47:47
Of each other. Um… what you imagine, given that they're androids, is that while.

[GM] 21:47:58
This, um… appears to be sort of like a physical battle, that likely what they are trying to do is override each other's code.

[GM] 21:48:08
Um… And so… Um… As they gain, like… domination over, like, one of them.

[GM] 21:48:20
Uh… the… the… you know, sort of body disappears in the VR scenario, um.

[GM] 21:48:28
And what is experienced in the real world is that.

[GM] 21:48:33
one of the security androids comes over. picks up the child that was defeated and unplugs them, and then carries them.

[GM] 21:48:40
Towards the elevator.

[Dex Miro] 21:48:43
Yeah, this place is rough.

[GM] 21:48:48
When the elevator comes down to pick up the security android.

[GM] 21:48:52
a new child or children, however long you guys are here for.

[GM] 21:48:56
walk off the elevator, and then go and, like.

[GM] 21:48:59
put themselves in places where. you know, children have been removed.

[GM] 21:49:12
Um… Dex, this, uh, sensor home… is not attached to the wall.

[GM] 21:49:22
So you can keep wearing it as long as you like.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:28
So I'm like a spectator, I'm not part of the game, and that's why they're not shooting me.

[GM] 21:49:31
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:33
Okay.

[GM] 21:49:36
It's like, it's not quite shooting, it's more like a Hunger Games scenario.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:40
Okay. Might be worse.

[GM] 21:49:46
It's definitely worse. It's definitely… I mean, like… Yeah. It's a lot more brutal, at least.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:48
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:50:07
So is it kind of like a VR helmet?

[GM] 21:50:10
That's what it looks like, um. It turns out, though, that… Um, there's a mode where.

[GM] 21:50:18
Uh, you don't have to be viewing the children and their sort of death match.

[GM] 21:50:22
You can actually just have it be, sort of, like.

[GM] 21:50:26
transparent. Yeah, it's got passed through.

[Ink] 21:50:28
It's got pastry. Now, we see his eyes, like, virtual eyes, like in the Apple, uh, Vision Pro.

[GM] 21:50:38
Sure. I don't know. I have not seen those.

[Ink] 21:50:41
If you haven't seen one of those.

[GM] 21:50:48
whatever's the coolest thing is what's… what's happening.

[Ink] 21:50:53
Alright.

[Ink] 21:50:58
Um, actually, before we go to 55B, can I go check back.

[Ink] 21:51:02
through 55A, where the kids came out. I want to slightly cautiously answer, like, you know, ready to escape very quickly and shut the door behind me.

[GM] 21:51:04
Sure. Sure.

[GM] 21:51:11
Sure.

[Ink] 21:51:15
We heard rustling before, which we assumed were the children that were hiding.

[Ink] 21:51:17
They said they want to go back to. Yeah.

[GM] 21:51:20
Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, you go and you kind of check out where you heard the noise. It was probably where the children were hiding.

[GM] 21:51:29
Um…

[GM] 21:51:34
Um… you don't really see too much else, uh… Looks like the children might have been trying to, like, create, like, a little, like, play area.

[GM] 21:51:46
Or, like, they were playing house or something. Um, you know, sort of setting up, like, a fort, or, I don't know, like… They're building something for themselves, it's hard to tell what exactly it was, but…

[Ink] 21:51:55
Okay.

[Ink] 21:52:01
Um, can I kind of rummage through things, I guess, look for marbles, anything else that looks interesting?

[GM] 21:52:06
Yeah, you look around, um, nothing… nothing strikes your eye.

[Ink] 21:52:11
Okay.

[GM] 21:52:12
You don't know if the children found the marbles in here, there's nothing to indicate that they did.

[GM] 21:52:18
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:52:25
Um, then I'd like to go to… back to 54B.

[Ink] 21:52:29
And check it out.

[GM] 21:52:31
Okay. 54b…

[GM] 21:52:37
Pretty much kind of the same situation, um…

[GM] 21:52:44
Only there's a dead body in this one.

[Ink] 21:52:46
Yeah. So I realize you're…

[Dex Miro] 21:52:48
Did I finish setting up the encrypted radio transmitter, or did we get interrupted by the… Okay.

[GM] 21:52:52
We'll assume you did. So you've got… Two transmitters set up on the base, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:52:57
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:52:57
Yep. Um, and it's, it's operating just fine, my, uh… Yeah. So we're good with that, right?

[GM] 21:53:06
Yeah, because the other one's hidden in the, uh… and the hunter, or whatever, the spider creature's layer is underneath, behind some webs.

[Ink] 21:53:14
Yeah.

[GM] 21:53:15
And this one's in here. They're like, we're gonna defeat the hardest things on the… On this base, and then… in their homerooms, we're gonna just, like… set up the transmitter so no one wants to go in there.

[Ink] 21:53:29
I think it's the safest way.

[GM] 21:53:31
Yeah. Okay, yeah. It's up and running.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:36
impersonal.

[Ink] 21:53:43
Awesome, so now we can go check out, uh… 55B?

[GM] 21:53:48
Yep. Um, this one is… a, um… whatchamacallit?

[GM] 21:53:55
airlock, but it is not locked. Um, 55B… Uh, you open the doors, banks of screens set for full spectrum analysis.

[GM] 21:54:09
Uh, there's a terminal that provides a visual feed of.

[GM] 21:54:14
stuff. Alright. Scientists. Is there a scientist here?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:54:22
He's a nerd.

[GM] 21:54:22
Okay, he peered. Scientist.

[GM] 21:54:27
Um… You see that this, uh, is a… extremely cutting-edge analysis device.

[GM] 21:54:37
Um… Do you want to play around on this terminal to figure out what it does?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:54:42
Of course I do.

[GM] 21:54:44
Alright, starts punching some keys, pulling some levers… turning some knobs.

[GM] 21:54:50
Um, it turns out that the, uh, other room… that you can sort of view into, uh, 55C.

[GM] 21:54:59
uh, is made for analyzing artifacts. So, these kind of weird things that you've been finding, you're able to actually determine.

[GM] 21:55:11
What they are. what their use is.

[Ink] 21:55:15
So we have a… a Javelin, right, and… Some purple crystals, maybe, still.

[GM] 21:55:21
Mm-hmm. Yeah, purple crystal… Javelin.

[Ink] 21:55:22
And some black marbles.

[GM] 21:55:28
Oh, you guys threw that one away, um… The one that Ricoh found.

[Ink] 21:55:33
Which one did we throw away?

[GM] 21:55:40
She handed to, like, threw it in the acid room or something, I can't remember what you threw it at.

[Ink] 21:55:45
Oh, shoot, yeah, the metal… He's a junk.

[GM] 21:55:48
Yeah, twisted slag. Um… We're 10 billion, actually.

[Ink] 21:55:52
But not this one that was worth a billion credits, you know?

[GM] 21:55:58
Um… Yeah, the Javelin, the marble, and the purple crystals.

[Ink] 21:56:03
Alright, can we take the time to analyze each one of those?

[GM] 21:56:06
Uh, it takes… as Zeke will tell you, one D10 hours.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:13
20-10 hours.

[GM] 21:56:13
To analyze one. Um… By the way, I will… so you don't feel any remorse, the twisted slag is actually just Twisted slag.

[GM] 21:56:25
It's just… it is worthless. doesn't do anything.

[Ink] 21:56:26
Okay.

[GM] 21:56:30
That's why I didn't feel bad having her hand that to you, and you throwing it.

[Ink] 21:56:31
Ah, yes.

[Ink] 21:56:34
Yeah, you handed it to us. That's funny. You know, that was what we're gonna do with it?

[GM] 21:56:39
No, no, I just, I, you know, it was appropriate. You guys were trying to figure out what to do, and I was like.

[GM] 21:56:44
I had rolled the, uh, artifact off a table, and I was like, yeah, this is useless, maybe they'll find a use for it, and then you just, like, chucked it. I was like, that's fine.

[Ink] 21:56:56
I can start with my marbles?

[GM] 21:56:56
Um… Alright. Uh, Zeke, roll 1D10.

[GM] 21:57:03
Dear, how long this takes to analyze?

[GM] 21:57:08
All right, what an excellent roll. Um… Yeah, Zeke… Zeke gets it, you know, tells you what to do with it, you put it in there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:09
So…

[GM] 21:57:21
Um… There's endless sensory and analytical… analytic devices craning and reaching towards the center. That's 55C.

[GM] 21:57:30
Um… So… Yeah, you do… you do some analysis.

[GM] 21:57:39
Um… turns out… the material, uh… is indestructible.

[GM] 21:57:49
It's a black marble that's indestructible.

[Ink] 21:57:55
So do I… I still don't know what, like, it's called or anything, though?

[GM] 21:58:00
Undiscovered material. You get to name it, you've discovered it.

[Ink] 21:58:02
I'm just gonna material.

[Ink] 21:58:08
ink destructible.

[GM] 21:58:11
In destructible. There you go.

[Ink] 21:58:22
It's got blue mark, alright.

[Ink] 21:58:30
Uh, to the javelin things.

[GM] 21:58:32
Javelin. Alright, uh, Zeke got a little bit better at this. Let's roll 1D5.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:39
Oh, look at the first time.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:42
oops.

[GM] 21:58:46
3. Do you guys want to sit around for 3 hours?

[Ink] 21:58:49
Sure, why not? What do we gotta be?

[GM] 21:58:52
Alright. 3 hours. Silver Lance, braided copper cables.

[GM] 21:58:59
Would floating in 0G, uh, points to previously unknown location.

[Ink] 21:59:08
It's pointing towards a location. When it's… when it's floating.

[GM] 21:59:10
So, you now begin to notice that if you just, like, if you're in, uh, 0G.

[GM] 21:59:15
And you're just… You just let it float. It eventually orients itself to a previously unknown location.

[Ink] 21:59:23
So it's like a compass to some…

[GM] 21:59:26
But it's just directing you to the things it doesn't know.

[GM] 21:59:33
I don't know what the use of that is, but that's what it does.

[Ink] 21:59:39
things it doesn't know what?

[GM] 21:59:39
things it doesn't know… it says… reading verbatim. Silver Lance braided copper cables. When floating in zero-G, points to.

[GM] 21:59:50
to previously unknown location.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:57
Great. For the completion-ist explorer in your life.

[GM] 21:59:58
It makes no sense to me.

[GM] 22:00:02
Like, don't you already know what you don't know?

[GM] 22:00:06
That's an unknown location.

[Ink] 22:00:07
Oh, I thought it was, like, get it twice to some place that we want to go, and it's gonna be our compass to this treasure.

[GM] 22:00:13
I mean, that sounds great. You wanted to do that instead?

[Ink] 22:00:17
Yes, I do, I wanted to do that. As long as it doesn't point to this.

[GM] 22:00:19
Too bad. This really obscure thing that I don't know how that's gonna work out for you.

[GM] 22:00:26
Um… Uh, purple crystal?

[Dex Miro] 22:00:27
What's the other thing, Crystal?

[Ink] 22:00:29
Yeah, like…

[GM] 22:00:32
Uh, alright, Zeke roll 1D4.

[GM] 22:00:41
Two… two hours, you guys want to just wait around 2 hours?

[Ink] 22:00:43
Sounds good.

[GM] 22:00:45
Tiny purple crystals, which grow on pseudo flesh and act as a fungus with a connected hive mind.

[GM] 22:00:52
You guys kind of already knew that, though.

[Ink] 22:00:54
Yeah.

[GM] 22:01:14
Zeke's pretty good at this, analyzing artifact stuff.

[Ink] 22:01:17
Yes, that's okay. Well, we won't… we won't start this room on fire, so slowly back out.

[Dex Miro] 22:01:23
No.

[GM] 22:01:26
However, I forgot.

[Ink] 22:01:26
Do you have any more artifacts?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:28
Because I'll analyze them.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:30
Oops.

[Ink] 22:01:34
That's not so excited.

[GM] 22:01:39
Um… In the process of, uh… doing the analysis.

[GM] 22:01:45
Not that this really matters, but like… Uh, Zeke, um…

[GM] 22:01:56
had the silver lance with braided copper cables, um… Activated? Like, he, like… accidentally set it in ZeroG, but that's also how I figured out what it did.

[GM] 22:02:08
Um… not a big issue.

[Ink] 22:02:13
It doesn't point towards anything important.

[GM] 22:02:14
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:02:24
Alright.

[GM] 22:02:26
But it also says previously unknown location.

[GM] 22:02:34
When floating in 0G points to previously unknown location.

[GM] 22:02:45
I don't know. I don't know, guys.

[Ink] 22:02:49
It'll point to, like, the Minotaur or something.

[GM] 22:02:52
Maybe. I don't know. It points up.

[Ink] 22:02:55
Giant compass. Yeah. Okay.

[Ink] 22:03:02
Um, I'm ready to go back to the elevator.

[GM] 22:03:04
Okay. Guys are the elevator. Uh… takes a little while before the, uh, lift shows up.

[GM] 22:03:12
Um, and then when you get on, do you want to go down or up?

[Ink] 22:03:18
Um, up to 23D. I think that's a…

[GM] 22:03:20
Or up to 23D. Bing!

[GM] 22:03:26
Alright…

[Dex Miro] 22:03:29
1023D.

[GM] 22:03:32
It's the, uh, elevator…

[GM] 22:03:41
Alright, lift the floor… Um… you step out of the elevator lift.

[GM] 22:03:52
Um, and there's… you immediately, uh… Notice on the… Walls around the… the lift.

[GM] 22:04:01
Um… entry? Uh, there's graffiti.

[GM] 22:04:05
with a smiley face that has a single tear in the left eye and says, welcome to.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:11
Jesus.

[Ink] 22:04:12
No, how's got away.

[GM] 22:04:14
Well, so it's like, if you were walking onto this, it would be indicating that you were going to.

[Ink] 22:04:20
Oh, you're going to… Gosh, we just can't…

[GM] 22:04:22
Yeah, so you guys just came from.

[GM] 22:04:31
Otherwise, you just see, uh… I mean, there's a door… Uh… to a hallway.

[GM] 22:04:38
I bet it's open.

[GM] 22:04:45
Well.

[Ink] 22:04:51
Um, okay. Well, I'm ready to go through the… door down the hallway. Uh, let's see… So, we… this is for one. We don't need to put anything on floor 1 for radio, right?

[GM] 22:05:03
Correct, you need to put one on floor. 6, 4, 3.1… And… 2.

[Ink] 22:05:08
And two, right?

[Ink] 22:05:13
Okay, so good there. Um, I guess I'm… I want to look at 23B first.

[GM] 22:05:21
Okay. Um… Turn the, uh… go down the hallway, turn right.

[GM] 22:05:31
So you had, uh, like, a small doorway. Um… There's a bunch of cubicles in this room.

[GM] 22:05:42
Uh, there's red emergency lighting. Um… And you can tell that, like, things have been shifted around essentially to, like.

[GM] 22:05:53
create a little bit of a makeshift… Um… Not fort, per se, but like.

[GM] 22:06:02
almost like a… like a, just like a… a protected area, so, like… Um… do you think, you know.

[GM] 22:06:10
after having listened for a while, and. looking around, you don't think anyone's in this sort of, like, camped over here?

[GM] 22:06:18
Um, but you do smell like burnt trash, and there's some smoke in this room.

[GM] 22:06:24
Um, and so, like, you find out that there's, like.

[GM] 22:06:27
kind of look around a little bit, and there's, like, lean-to forts, and strung-up tarps.

[GM] 22:06:32
Um… It's like somebody's been camping here.

[GM] 22:06:38
Uh, but it's hard to tell who.

[Ink] 22:06:47
We kind of rummage through things carefully.

[GM] 22:06:50
Sure, um…

[GM] 22:06:56
Do you… Do I have a thing?

[GM] 22:07:08
Um, go ahead and roll a D100.

[Ink] 22:07:19
Man, I need to save that role for something else.

[GM] 22:07:19
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 22:07:24
14.

[GM] 22:07:25
Alright, you find, uh… a frag grenade.

[Ink] 22:07:37
Like, an artifact spread to me?

[GM] 22:07:40
Nope, just a frag greeting.

[Ink] 22:07:43
Alright, better replace one of my… Perfect.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:47
Any signs of who's been camping here?

[GM] 22:07:50
Uh, given the grenade, you think probably… maybe a diver?

[GM] 22:07:57
Um, you know, someone who's been trying to…

[Dex Miro] 22:07:57
Yeah.

[GM] 22:08:03
extricate, uh, artifacts, maybe? Or maybe it's, uh… One of, um… Commander Kilroy's, uh, people.

[GM] 22:08:16
The clean… Yeah. Divers are, like.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:17
But not cold. Other troubleshooters, not divers.

[GM] 22:08:22
More specifically, the, like, adventurers. You guys would be considered divers.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:26
Okay.

[GM] 22:08:27
Except for you're working for Kilroy, so are you guys… Divers, or are you, uh… troubleshooters.

[Ink] 22:08:34
We're pretending to be, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:08:44
Diaper shooters… I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 22:08:50
Any idea, like, can we tell how long it's been since they were here?

[GM] 22:08:56
Um, given the smoke. Uh, probably within… 24 hours.

[Dex Miro] 22:09:02
Okay.

[Ink] 22:09:16
So, we might assume that they came in. through 23C, then.

[Ink] 22:09:22
Because that's an interesting point.

[GM] 22:09:25
Perhaps?

[Ink] 22:09:27
Okay, so let's, uh, can we check out 23C carefully?

[GM] 22:09:30
Sure. Uh, this one has a locked door.

[GM] 22:09:35
to it.

[Ink] 22:09:41
Oh, I'll unlock it.

[GM] 22:09:42
Alright, you unlock it. Uh, on the other side of the door, you see 11 gleaming escape pods.

[GM] 22:09:51
Um, it's very clean in here. Uh, like… almost so clean that maybe… someone hasn't actually come through this room.

[GM] 22:10:02
Um, things are untouched and spotless. Um…

[GM] 22:10:12
All of the, um…

[GM] 22:10:17
escape pods appear to be in working order. They have sufficient air, water, and food for 3 days for 3 people each.

[GM] 22:10:27
And there are 11 of them. So… theoretically couldn't have 33 people saved through these escape pods.

[Ink] 22:10:35
And what kind of range would they have?

[GM] 22:10:43
Um…

[GM] 22:10:48
Well, 3 of them are… The untouched spotless have 3 cryo pods each. Oh, I guess within each one of them, there's a cryo pod.

[GM] 22:10:56
infinite? range? I mean, it kind of just… they fire out into space, and you're in cryo sleep, basically.

[GM] 22:11:04
Uh, if you choose to go on the cryo pod, or you could be awake for 3 days.

[Ink] 22:11:05
to progress.

[GM] 22:11:09
But… if you go in the cryo pod, like, it'll just keep going until you… crash on a planet, I guess.

[Ink] 22:11:15
Does it have propulsion, or does it need to be launched?

[GM] 22:11:17
No, it's just launched. There does appear to be a way to launch them in a particular direction, but… Um, yeah.

[Ink] 22:11:27
Okay, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:11:30
So all the pods are here, right?

[GM] 22:11:30
Um, you said… All the pods are here. You suspect, though, if you did try to launch one of these, there's a good chance.

[GM] 22:11:38
Commander Kilroy's fleet would try to shoot it down.

[Ink] 22:11:42
shoot it down, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:43
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:11:56
Um, alright, so we don't see any artifacts in these.

[Ink] 22:11:59
They're probably not here, yeah.

[GM] 22:12:01
Not nothing that seems to…

[Ink] 22:12:10
Um, the interest of facility there, is there anything I can do to jerry-rig so that I have control of opening that from the outside, or would there be any problem opening that from the outside?

[GM] 22:12:18
Opening what?

[Ink] 22:12:20
Um, if we were to fly up to the door here at the entrance, would we have a problem getting in from the outside?

[GM] 22:12:25
No, no, no, you could. You could easily open the store.

[Ink] 22:12:42
Okay. I was getting yelled at by ChatGPT for generating images too quickly.

[GM] 22:12:46
Hm?

[Ink] 22:12:47
Um, I want to go check out 23A, but I don't think I want to go through it yet.

[GM] 22:12:53
23A.

[GM] 22:13:00
Um…

[GM] 22:13:05
Uh, this is a relatively small room. It's more of, like, uh… Um, a security checkpoint.

[GM] 22:13:13
There's, um… you know, kind of the hallway kind of keeps going, uh, but there's, like.

[GM] 22:13:21
Uh, a room, there's some barred gates that block passage.

[GM] 22:13:25
Um… you can see… a series of weapon detectors.

[GM] 22:13:30
Embedded in the walls, um… And, like, the… there's a bulletproof glass box.

[GM] 22:13:38
In the center, um… And atop it is.

[GM] 22:13:43
a 360-degree machine gun swivel turret.

[GM] 22:13:56
Um, upon closer examination. It looks like this, uh, checkpoint.

[GM] 22:14:03
has… has been used. I mean, not necessarily super recently, but, like, you see, like.

[GM] 22:14:10
Um, bullet scarring and some scorch marks and stuff.

[Ink] 22:14:17
But no dead bodies laying around.

[GM] 22:14:19
No dead bodies.

[Ink] 22:14:25
Um, is the machine gun not in working order?

[GM] 22:14:29
Uh… yes, and now that you're looking at it.

[GM] 22:14:33
You can see that there's a security Android that's, um… mounted on it, like, or mounted to it, like… appears to be manning it.

[Ink] 22:14:42
Oh, it's currently manned by it. Okay. And are we… are we in the room with him right now, or are we still, like, behind a door looking in?

[GM] 22:14:45
Yeah.

[GM] 22:14:51
You're kind of seeing this from a distance.

[Ink] 22:14:53
Okay. So has he seen us?

[GM] 22:14:56
No, appears to be facing the other way.

[Ink] 22:15:00
Oh, like, he's concerned more about something coming from that direction.

[GM] 22:15:05
Yeah, or maybe that's just, like, the… standard direction in which things come from.

[Ink] 22:15:10
Okay. Alright, um… I'd rather go down the hallway and then check out 23… T.

[GM] 22:15:23
Uh, 23E? G. Gotcha.

[Ink] 22:15:26
Yeah, G as in, uh, goat.

[GM] 22:15:31
Uh, Employer Rec Center. Scattered gym equipment, shattered mirrors, smells like rust.

[GM] 22:15:38
Um… There's some equipment lockers… Um…

[GM] 22:15:51
Yeah, there's some equipment lockers…

[GM] 22:15:56
some gym equipment if you want to work out.

[Ink] 22:16:05
But no artificial.

[GM] 22:16:07
Well, I don't know, did you look in the lockers?

[Ink] 22:16:09
Oh, that's true. Yeah, let's pokes and blockers.

[GM] 22:16:11
Okay. Start opening up blockers. Um… open one, there's nothing in there, we'll open another one, there's nothing in there.

[GM] 22:16:19
open another one, there's a person who's unconscious in there wearing a.

[GM] 22:16:22
heavily patched vac suit, and they don't have a helmet on.

[GM] 22:16:25
They're unconscious.

[Ink] 22:16:29
Unconscious. All right, I see this is the eligible for, uh… Scanning to see if they're an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:34
I scan them.

[GM] 22:16:36
Alright, get out your scanner. You start waving the wand over them.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:39
Can we make sure they don't die while we're scanning them?

[GM] 22:16:43
Uh, they seem to be breathing fine. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:16:46
Wow. Wait. Okay, so the atmosphere is fine in here.

[GM] 22:16:51
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They just, for whatever reason, they have this suit on.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:51
Okay.

[GM] 22:16:57
Um… before you complete your scan.

[GM] 22:17:02
Uh, the person wakes up, and they go, whoop!

[GM] 22:17:05
What are you doing? Who are you?

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:10
Just making sure you're okay.

[GM] 22:17:13
Oh… no, I'm not okay. My… partner knocked me out.

[GM] 22:17:18
Oh, I got the worst headache.

[Ink] 22:17:23
Who's your partner?

[GM] 22:17:26
Uh, his name's Jim. Um, we came here… trying to find, you know.

[GM] 22:17:34
Loot. Some money, cash, whatever.

[GM] 22:17:39
We found something… I stashed it, and he… he was trying to get me to… tell them where it was.

[GM] 22:17:47
And then… I was refusing, and he knock me out.

[Ink] 22:17:54
Yes. Okay.

[Ink] 22:17:59
Since that's in the thing. Where did, uh, where have you been on the station?

[GM] 22:18:05
Um… Hold on a sec, I have to figure out where he's been.

[GM] 22:18:13
Uh…

[GM] 22:18:21
No. Nope.

[GM] 22:18:26
Uh, let's see… I've been on the.

[GM] 22:18:32
entrance here. We came in through the… Um, that room with all the… the pods in it.

[GM] 22:18:43
And then, uh, we went down to… I think it was the third floor… Um… we had a pet.

[Ink] 22:18:52
down to the first one?

[GM] 22:18:53
pass through some weird-ass man. There's, like, a labyrinth in there.

[GM] 22:18:57
On the second floor… Um… But then we got down to the… Third floor… Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:03
guitar.

[GM] 22:19:13
I'll tell you, if you guys can get me off this station, I will tell you where the artifact where I hit it.

[Ink] 22:19:23
Okay, his name is Gino, or his buddy's name is Jim?

[GM] 22:19:26
What'd you say? His buddy's name was Jim.

[Ink] 22:19:27
His name was Jim, or his buddy's name was Jim.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:34
Uh… what's your name? Like…

[GM] 22:19:36
Hank.

[Ink] 22:19:37
Let's take a look like.

[GM] 22:19:41
What's he look like? Um… short-cropped brown hair, um… But bangs?

[Ink] 22:19:42
Yeah.

[GM] 22:19:49
Um… Not, like, overly long bangs, but, like, longer than his short hair.

[GM] 22:19:57
Uh, he's got… no glasses. His eyebrows are kind of thin.

[GM] 22:20:03
It's got a… it's got a butt chin.

[GM] 22:20:11
Is the proper name for butt chin a dimpled chin? What's the name?

[Ink] 22:20:11
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:20:19
Because it is dimple, right? Like… Or is it not a temple? I don't know.

[GM] 22:20:27
What's the proper name for butt chin? Now I have to Google it. I'm gonna get flagged for this one.

[GM] 22:20:43
Left chin. He has a cleft chin.

[Ink] 22:20:54
Uh, he says his name's Hank, right? Alright. I'd say we take ink with us.

[GM] 22:20:56
Hank.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:00
I'm still scanning him, right?

[GM] 22:21:03
Uh, I mean, he was kind of offended by you scanning him, so he kind of, like.

[GM] 22:21:09
shimmied away, disrupted your scan, you'll have to start all over.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:13
Well, it's… no, I kept following him, just going up and down with the wand.

[GM] 22:21:20
You just…

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:20
Like, stay still, dude! Hey, we're just trying to make sure you don't have any broken bones, or everything's working properly.

[GM] 22:21:24
No, I don't have a… I just have a headache, man. I don't need… here… Alright, alright, fine, just, just scan my HUD.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:27
Yeah, we're trying to figure out what the headache is. Calm down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:32
Just sit down.

[GM] 22:21:33
Just… just… no, I'm not… just scan my head.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:34
Sit the fuck down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:37
Fine, then just stand there.

[GM] 22:21:37
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:41
Alright. 10 minutes later…

[GM] 22:21:41
Okay. Bye.

[GM] 22:21:49
He's like, really? This is taking so long, man.

[GM] 22:21:52
You're not even scanning my… my head. Yeah. He's an android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:54
Well, 10 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:58
Fuck! I mean, hey!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:01
Not everybody's an android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:02
Everyone's an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:13
What do we do with the androids, guys?

[Ink] 22:22:22
Do we determine Hank was an android or not?

[Dex Miro] 22:22:27
I mean, Murderbot knows that, I don't know if he's… so, wait a second, there's do it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:29
Yeah, no, I discreetly tell… he's an android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:35
It's an android.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:35
Do we have a hand signal for that? We have hands, like, both of them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:37
Huh?

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:39
I use my, uh… what the hell is this? Don't I have, like, a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:47
It's certainly not Espernetic feedback loop.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:53
That's funny, yeah, we… we all have mods, but we have no way to send text messages to each other without typing.

[Ink] 22:23:00
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:05
Um, how about this? Every time an Android is scanned, I scan an Android, I'll point to my snake eyes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:14
on my, uh, overalls.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:22
So that's what I'm doing.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:22
Oh. Without the 4 or the 6? Sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:26
Both of them. Look at here, look at my… look at my dad!

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:31
Yay!

[Ink] 22:23:51
Alright, so we'll take, uh, Inc with us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:53
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:57
So, where'd you come from before you arrived at the station, Hank?

[GM] 22:24:02
Oh, um… We were coming from a mining colony.

[GM] 22:24:09
frankly, we… I'll be honest, guys. We left before our debts were paid, but we're hoping to score big on this place so that, um… We could, like, just pay off our debt.

[GM] 22:24:20
And I have to go back. But… we'll do that if they catch us.

[GM] 22:24:27
I'm kind of hoping that they won't.

[Ink] 22:24:39
Um, which I got 23, huh?

[GM] 22:24:42
Sure. Across the hall.

[GM] 22:24:50
Look at the storage room, uh, there's smash chairs, broken shelves.

[GM] 22:24:54
Tangle of destroyed boxes. Um… on the wall… you see a… crude sick cabling and duct tape.

[GM] 22:25:07
With a label that reads, access. Looks like you would maybe, like… put your eyes up to it.

[GM] 22:25:15
Like, it's like a retinal scanner, maybe?

[Ink] 22:25:21
So it's locking us out of something.

[GM] 22:25:24
Yeah, um… It's hard to know what, though.

[GM] 22:25:32
It's not like there's, like, a door next to it, or, like, a locker or anything.

[Ink] 22:25:53
So nothing else we can do in here, other than put our eye on that thing.

[GM] 22:25:58
I guess, yeah.

[Ink] 22:26:02
Hank, have you been in this room before?

[GM] 22:26:06
He says, uh… I don't remember. My head hurts real bad, man. Maybe… maybe I was here, but, like, when I got hit in the head, it was… Cut on my short-term memory… I don't know.

[Ink] 22:26:18
Gotcha. I think you want to stick your eye in the skin?

[GM] 22:26:25
I mean, I don't want to. Are you asking me to?

[Ink] 22:26:29
Yeah, would you do that? I think you might be able to open it.

[GM] 22:26:32
Okay. Um… Do you guys got any food on you? I could do this in trade. Give me, like, a…

[Ink] 22:26:40
Oh yeah, I totally have some chips and from the vending machine.

[GM] 22:26:44
Alright, cool. I'll do it for some chips. He walks over to the retinal scanner.

[Ink] 22:26:48
Alright.

[GM] 22:26:49
puts his face up against it. There's a flash of light, you can kind of tell from the periphery around his face.

[GM] 22:26:57
Uh, it kind of pulls back, it's like, oh!

[GM] 22:26:59
That's, like, really bright. Oh. God.

[GM] 22:27:04
Jeez. He, like, kind of reaches out his hand, kind of blindly, like, I'll take those chips now.

[Ink] 22:27:12
Is the door open? Ah, alright.

[GM] 22:27:13
No, nothing happened.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:17
And… can you still see?

[Ink] 22:27:17
Definitely give him his chips, he earned him.

[GM] 22:27:18
He's like, yeah, I'm starting to be able to see again. Ugh.

[GM] 22:27:21
Who designs? Like, not really, like, a scanner so much as a blinder, man.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:39
So, nothing happened.

[Ink] 22:27:41
blow-torched or anything? We just don't see where it goes. It doesn't seem to do anything, okay?

[Ink] 22:27:45
We don't know what it's for. Gotcha. Not even the scientists can figure it out.

[GM] 22:27:46
Not that you could tell.

[GM] 22:27:53
I don't know, is the scientist gonna spend a while looking at it?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:27:59
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:02
You don't seem very excited about it.

[GM] 22:28:05
Scientists are just here to do the stuff that nobody else wants to do.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:28:09
That's pretty much, yeah, scientists is just, like, the science slave.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:14
Are you gonna feed the scientist, too?

[Ink] 22:28:17
Yeah, I got chip… I got more snacks, right? I rated that machine.

[Ink] 22:28:22
I gotta… I gotta… I got a Chaco Taco bar here.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:28:25
Scientists… yeah, scientists just want some food.

[Ink] 22:28:30
with real caramel.

[GM] 22:28:34
Um… So, uh, your scientist takes a look at it, and… It seems like these cables are designed to, like, carry a bunch of data, like, it's not… you know, this is the… they're overly large for any kind of just, like.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:28:34
Oh, Carmen

[GM] 22:28:52
typical retinal scanner? Um… That being said, your scientist is a, what, xenobiologist? What are you?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:01
Yeah, as a xenobiologist. I'm an incredible expert in… expertise in artifacts from my neurobiology training.

[GM] 22:29:06
Yeah. Um, but this is not an artifact.

[GM] 22:29:15
You don't have… you don't happen to have, like, uh, electronics or computers as a skill, Zeke, do you?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:20
I have, like, no skills.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:23
No.

[GM] 22:29:23
Don't, don't, don't shame yourself, you're, you're okay. I know that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:26
I… oh, I know math, but I have some math skills.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:32
There's been so many times this campaign where someone was like, hey, who knows some math?

[Dex Miro] 22:29:32
My skills are…

[Ink] 22:29:33
My robust got computer skills.

[GM] 22:29:37
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Ink] 22:29:42
Uh, Murderbot's got computer skills.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:43
Um, we were in the room with the mathematical symbols, and we didn't even look at those, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:45
I've got computer skills.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:47
That's a good point. I should have brought it up.

[GM] 22:29:50
Should have brought it up. What'd you say, Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:53
I got computer skills.

[GM] 22:29:57
Um… Yeah, I mean, you know, these cables… I mean, really beyond the, like.

[GM] 22:30:06
Hard to tell what they're for beyond just, like.

[GM] 22:30:09
There's definitely, like, data transmission happening between this point and… somewhere else.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:15
That's it.

[GM] 22:30:17
That's it.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:18
Is this, like, some kind of rapid brain scanner, so if anybody's dumb enough to come up to it and they're not already on Android, they can make an Android out of you.

[GM] 22:30:26
Do say that out loud.

[Ink] 22:30:26
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:27
I don't know, sure.

[GM] 22:30:31
Hank's like, what? What the You think I just got my brain scanned?

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:39
Don't worry, they don't need to scan your brain.

[GM] 22:30:44
Who would want to scan my brain? Like, why would they want to do that?

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:46
No, they don't.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:48
they're not doing that right now.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:51
They already had… they already have it.

[GM] 22:30:51
They're not doing it right now! He just said, if I put my eyeballs up to the… That might scan my brain.

[Dex Miro] 22:30:52
Thank you. Hey, did anybody tell you… Anything about this station before you came here?

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:58
Yeah, what do you know about this station, man?

[GM] 22:31:02
We just heard it was a good score, like, that, um… Yeah, I found it. I told you I'll tell you where it's at if you… If you get me off the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:03
You know, did you find anything in this score yet?

[Ink] 22:31:07
Good.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:07
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:31:11
bit of observation.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:12
Wait, so Jim… Jim doesn't have it anymore? You… you hit it?

[Ink] 22:31:16
He didn't… he didn't give it to Jim, yeah.

[GM] 22:31:16
I hit it. No, no, I hit it and.

[Ink] 22:31:19
That's why Jim hit him.

[GM] 22:31:19
Yeah, Jim hit me. He decided he would rather just go backtrack where we'd been.

[GM] 22:31:24
Because clearly, like, we were together most of the time.

[GM] 22:31:27
And so then he was gonna just try and backtrack to find out where I hit it, so he could keep it for himself.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:33
What does Jim look like?

[GM] 22:31:36
Uh, he's got long black hair, um… Have you heard of heavy metal?

[Ink] 22:31:45
Yeah, I got some of that.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:45
It looks like he's in the band.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:48
Yeah, that's what I'm made up of.

[GM] 22:31:48
He looks like he was in a heavy metal band, is… yeah.

[Ink] 22:31:54
Um…

[GM] 22:32:08
I always say in the song, Neverland.

[Ink] 22:32:16
No.

[GM] 22:32:32
He said his favorite band got accused of destroying a thing called Napster, and he was, like, really defensive of the band.

[Ink] 22:32:51
Let's check out, uh, 23E.

[GM] 22:32:54
23E. It's another, uh… Another security checkpoint, although this one is blown apart.

[GM] 22:33:04
Um… the machine gun is destroyed, the security android that was manning it is completely shredded.

[GM] 22:33:09
Uh, it's Logic Core is gone. Um… The bulletproof class has also been destroyed. Um, probably… from some sort of explosive.

[GM] 22:33:24
everything's just kind of wrecked. Um… the gate, uh, because of the damage it sustained.

[GM] 22:33:33
It's kind of stuck. You have to force it open.

[Ink] 22:33:49
Well, I guess we'll, uh… Hey, Jimmy, let us know if anything jogs your memory here.

[GM] 22:33:56
No, no. Um, we, um… We didn't come to this.

[Ink] 22:33:56
Hey, Hank.

[GM] 22:34:04
way we… we… Flew in… on the other side of this, he, like, points to the other side of the gate, he's like.

[GM] 22:34:12
There's another docking area over there. So, like, we came in… Docked.

[GM] 22:34:20
start going through things, and then… after we, like, we turned around and came back, and we were like, oh, there must be another docking point.

[GM] 22:34:27
Came back round, and that's when, um… I guess maybe Jim just got tired? He just, like… was kind of getting frustrated, and… decided that's why he wanted to just, like, take the thing and get out of here.

[Ink] 22:34:46
So, Hank… Hank claims that he maybe came in 22A.

[GM] 22:34:50
Yeah. Yep.

[Ink] 22:34:51
And then flew around to 23C. And he's never passed through 23E.

[Ink] 22:34:58
And we would assume… since we sensed it, we didn't see any ship outside of 23C that Jim.

[GM] 22:34:58
No, yes.

[Ink] 22:35:05
Uh, yeah, the gym abandoned, took the ship away.

[GM] 22:35:11
Yes. But you also know that Hank is an android.

[Ink] 22:35:12
Because we have no way of moving forward. Okay.

[Ink] 22:35:21
But we didn't see a way of moving from 23C to 22A.

[GM] 22:35:25
Well, through these security checkpoints, but he's saying that he didn't.

[Ink] 22:35:27
Through space. Yeah.

[GM] 22:35:28
He didn't move through those.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:29
Wait, hold on. So, his memories…

[Dex Miro] 22:35:29
We just… we don't know where he goes. moved while he was unconscious.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:33
are of a human,

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:35
that this station…

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:37
scanned and implanted into this Android, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:43
Am I correct? No, I'm asking…

[GM] 22:35:44
Do you say that out loud?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:45
I'm asking…

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:48
I'm asking… I'm asking you.

[GM] 22:35:53
A guy named Hank, I guess.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:54
Okay, but we don't know if this happened years ago, or if this loot is even around, or…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:03
the system copied his partner…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:07
Or the partner actually got off the…

[GM] 22:36:08
Right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:11
this, this, you know, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:13
We don't know any of this. Yes?

[GM] 22:36:16
I mean, there may not have even been a Hank ever.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:19
Oh, alright. Well, there… yes, there is no Murderbot, in essence, I mean…

[GM] 22:36:19
Maybe these are all just manufactured memories.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:26
For Christ's sake.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:29
Okay, I'm just checking, just checking, just making sure.

[GM] 22:36:32
Yeah, yeah.

[Ink] 22:36:40
Alright, so do we… we don't see any… obvious danger passing through this room.

[GM] 22:36:46
Through the security checkpoint? No. It's pretty messed up, but there's no obvious danger.

[Ink] 22:36:47
Yeah, it looks pretty messed up.

[Ink] 22:36:53
Alright, I get cautiously push forward.

[GM] 22:36:57
Yeah, cautiously, what? Okay, you're gonna have to actually push, though. Someone's gonna have to use some strength to open that gate.

[Ink] 22:36:58
push forward. Yeah.

[GM] 22:37:06
Who wants to show off? Alright.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:08
Oh, oh, me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:12
I… no. But I can do more than scan artifacts.

[Ink] 22:37:12
You have strength?

[Ink] 22:37:16
Okay.

[GM] 22:37:19
Are you trying to impress Noriko? What are you… what are you doing here?

[Dex Miro] 22:37:19
No, don't do it. Don't do it, ask Carnoc to do it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:22
I mean, she is quite attractive, being bald and all.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:24
I feel inadequate.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:26
I need to increase my self-esteem.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:31
Oh, no.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:33
That was it.

[Ink] 22:37:37
At least it's not a double step.

[GM] 22:37:41
Uh, you…

[Dex Miro] 22:37:41
The best way to increase your self-esteem is always to do difficult things you're not good at in front of a bunch of people.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:45
That's exactly right.

[GM] 22:37:46
Thank you, yeah. You get on the gate.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:48
This is embarrassing for you.

[GM] 22:37:52
And you just push. I mean, you're pushing the hardest you ever pushed in your entire life.

[GM] 22:37:57
And you just… fart so hard.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:01
Oh. My. God.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:03
Oh, my God!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:04
That was the sound of the door budging.

[GM] 22:38:08
You do get the door open, but. You've… Everyone's laughing at you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:10
Not without…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:11
How's the door?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:14
I'm not. I don't understand any of this.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:16
laughing with me.

[GM] 22:38:19
Uh, for failing that you take two points of stress.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:22
No. I am pretty stressed.

[GM] 22:38:31
Do you worry that maybe Hank's gonna go tell somebody about it? So, it's stressful.

[GM] 22:38:40
All right, you push forward into 22B. 22B reception area.

[Ink] 22:38:41
You can tell.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:38:47
We'll go back, guys

[GM] 22:38:49
Wide open space. Uh, it's filthy, but it was once luxurious, uh… carpet's real nice, except for it's burnt in places.

[GM] 22:38:58
There's, uh, scattered bullet casings and, um.

[GM] 22:39:04
There's a desk that's riddled with bullet holes. Uh, there's a terminal that's broken.

[GM] 22:39:11
And… also…

[GM] 22:39:19
I don't know.

[GM] 22:39:30
I'll draw your attention to the upper left slash… middle of this. You see a corpse.

[GM] 22:39:38
Swaying from the rafters, hung by electrical extension cord.

[GM] 22:39:42
And on the wall is written one way out.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:51
Somehow gonna take that as a positive message.

[GM] 22:39:55
You know what, take that as what?

[Dex Miro] 22:39:56
No, it's not a positive message, it's saying the only way out is to hack yourself.

[GM] 22:40:01
Yeah. Um… Does anyone have firearms training?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:40:07
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:08
Karnak?

[GM] 22:40:08
Karnak, you can tell that the bullets… Uh, casings are from a high-end modified pulse rifle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:17
Oh, boy.

[Dex Miro] 22:40:19
Wait, so he did get shot, he just didn't just hang himself.

[GM] 22:40:23
No, no, no. Um… the corpse is… is just hung.

[GM] 22:40:31
But the, like, you can see the bolt holes around them.

[GM] 22:40:33
Those are not in a pattern that would suggest that he was hanging there and then someone shot around him. It suggests that at some point there was a firefight in this room.

[GM] 22:40:43
Um, and those bullet casings are from that firefight.

[GM] 22:40:46
And that he was hung maybe after, given the bullet holes.

[GM] 22:41:03
Um… since we're on this page, I forgot to reveal this one, which is the upper right.

[GM] 22:41:10
This was the picture of all the children being plugged into each other.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:14
Excuse me.

[GM] 22:41:21
Let me know when you would like to return back to the map.

[Ink] 22:41:23
Yes. Okay. It's not, it's H-E-L.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:41:28
Your prescription.

[GM] 22:41:28
So, human emulation lab.

[Ink] 22:41:32
Oh…

[Ink] 22:41:42
That's funny, they wanted to go back to the initialization left.

[GM] 22:41:57
Hank's like, um… I don't remember that guy being there.

[GM] 22:42:01
That's new.

[Ink] 22:42:07
They really look that fresh.

[GM] 22:42:09
He's not super fresh. Um…

[GM] 22:42:17
Yeah. I think it's like… I don't know.

[GM] 22:42:24
Maybe we were… It could have happened, like, sometime after… after I… after we, like… But we came back through, it's only been, like, a day.

[GM] 22:42:39
I don't know, man. That seems… I can't really smell them. Do you guys smell them?

[Dex Miro] 22:42:49
Do we?

[GM] 22:42:50
You do not.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:03
Maybe you were unconscious longer than you thought, Hank.

[GM] 22:43:09
I mean, but how long is just a head… bloated the head, like… What, like, 2 days even, like, if I was out that long.

[GM] 22:43:18
That seems overly long, right? I mean… any longer than that, I would have, like, probably.

[GM] 22:43:23
started showing signs of dying or something, right? Can't you only live… go, like… 48 hours without water or something.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:34
I don't know, do I know that?

[GM] 22:43:39
It's a pretty good approximation, you think? So, speaking of which, um, you guys got anything to drink?

[Dex Miro] 22:43:42
Yeah.

[GM] 22:43:48
Chips were pretty salty.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:52
I don't know, do we? Do you bring them?

[Dex Miro] 22:43:55
I don't know why none of the rest of us picked up anything out of the vending machine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:59
Well, I don't know why I didn't pick up anything at the vending machine.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:59
But…

[Ink] 22:44:06
I have some, uh, techno company COLA. I'll give it to him in good faith, but he's gotta stick his eye in the next thing I ask him to.

[GM] 22:44:17
He's like, I can do that, that's fine. That will return us to the other… to the map.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:26
Burger economy on the space station.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:34
So, I mean, that's not Jim, right?

[GM] 22:44:38
No, that's not true.

[Ink] 22:44:41
I love that question. Dex definitely should say that one out.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:52
Alright, so we have no idea who this guy is.

[Dex Miro] 22:44:55
Those of you have any kind of, like, uniform on?

[Dex Miro] 22:45:00
Look, he doesn't look like one of the troubleshooters or anything, does he?

[GM] 22:45:02
No, it doesn't look like a troubleshooter, but, um… The uniform he's wearing is vaguely similar to.

[GM] 22:45:13
the uniforms that you saw in the human emulation lab.

[GM] 22:45:18
It's not exactly the same, but it's pretty similar.

[Ink] 22:45:18
Gotcha. I guess Murderbot, do you want to go scan him, maybe understand the cause of death?

[Ink] 22:45:27
See if he has any implants, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

[Ink] 22:45:31
I want his… I want his core.

[Ink] 22:45:37
do it so that it doesn't alarm, uh, Jim.

[Ink] 22:45:42
Our hank, rather.

[GM] 22:45:47
I was murderbot scan them. Okay. Murderbot goes up, starts scanning him, and Hank is immediately, like, kind of like, why are you scanning him, man? He's dead.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:49
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:45:49
number of sleep.

[Ink] 22:45:59
I gotta find out why I died.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:59
This doesn't scan for health, it just scans… it also scans to see why he died from, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:05
other things, Hank.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:07
Calm down.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:08
It looks like it was probably the rope.

[GM] 22:46:10
Yeah, it seems pretty obvious here, man.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:11
Well, we'll try to figure out, you know, if he was… there was something else that caused it, or if it was the rope, you know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:19
You never know!

[Ink] 22:46:21
How long's he been… no, how long has he been dead?

[Ink] 22:46:23
Why doesn't he smell good?

[Dex Miro] 22:46:24
Oh, that's a good thing to figure out. We do actually want to know that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:25
That, too! We're trying to figure everything out!

[Ink] 22:46:29
We're not weirdos.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:30
Yeah, calm down, Hank, stop being paranoid!

[GM] 22:46:30
Alright. Don't be terrified. Don't, don't. Um… Alright, so you finished scanning, there's a little bing!

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:36
Don't be suspicious. Don't be suspicious.

[GM] 22:46:44
Um… definitely an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:47
I attempt to die.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:49
Does the scatter, like, say that out loud, and Murderbot has to, like, grab it?

[Ink] 22:46:50
He locates.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:52
No, there's no… it doesn't… there's no, uh, voice…

[GM] 22:46:53
It doesn't say it out loud, but, like… But when Hank hears the ding, he is like, well, how long did it say he was dead for?

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:05
Shit.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:06
make something up right about.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:08
5 hours.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:11
That doesn't sound right.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:14
2 hours.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:17
20 minutes.

[Ink] 22:47:17
I mean, we wouldn't smell you out in 2 hours, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:20
Yeah, of course old smell, like…

[Ink] 22:47:22
Seems reasonable.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:23
I don't know, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:27
I don't think a course would smell after 2 hours?

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:31
Uh, maybe I could be wrong?

[GM] 22:47:33
No, I don't think it does. Um… things like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:37
I think maybe… maybe the body might expel some stuff, but…

[GM] 22:47:44
Hank seems to accept that. He's like, oh, okay, so it must have happened after we had already left.

[GM] 22:47:49
And Jim has hit me on the head, so that's… yeah, that's how… that's probably how.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:54
Yeah…

[Dex Miro] 22:47:55
We're going with 5 hours.

[Murderbot V2] 22:47:56
That's how it happened.

[GM] 22:47:58
Yeah. Yeah, okay. That makes sense.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:01
Calm down, man.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:03
Wait, so he… so he is an android and Murderbot tries to take out his core while he's… Hank's not looking.

[GM] 22:48:03
Um, call.

[GM] 22:48:11
Hold on, I need to crack this guy's skull open.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:13
Yeah, hey, just, I'm just gonna take a look around here. I mean, he's dead.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:15
I mean, I have no idea how big a car is, or how difficult it is to do.

[Ink] 22:48:16
Well, it's like hitting, like, in his…

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:17
We're doing a more thorough, a more thorough autopsy here.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:24
I think you might not want to look at this.

[GM] 22:48:24
Uh, the. the easiest way to, uh, access this, though, will be to cut this guy down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:32
Sure, well, yeah, we should cut off, you know, you know, out of respect, we should cut them down.

[Ink] 22:48:33
has come down.

[GM] 22:48:38
Okay. You cut them down. Crumple.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:46
So, cuts of that out of respect, but just lets him, like.

[GM] 22:48:50
Yeah. Hits the ground with a thump.

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:57
Okay.

[GM] 22:48:59
And I guess, kind of behind the desk, you've located the logic where you know where it's at, you kind of…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:03
Yeah, I did that, and then…

[GM] 22:49:07
Doesn't someone have a penknife? Yeah, use your penknife to extract the, uh, Logic core.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:09
I do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:12
Yeah, with my first date, I… so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:18
it up to make it look like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:20
it… it doesn't look like a…

[Ink] 22:49:22
Um, cross his arms real nice, and then say a few words over him. We're about.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:24
an Android.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:25
Yeah, I put a sheet over him or something, I don't know.

[GM] 22:49:30
Okay. Yep. Got logic core.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:30
Logic core received…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:34
Logic core is in your inventory.

[GM] 22:49:41
Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:44
Um, let's see here, what could I do?

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:47
Oh, looky-loo. No purple crystal…

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:51
OS frenetic.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:54
Is it possible to scan logic cores in? This isn't something.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:57
I was gonna say, can we put it into a computer?

[Dex Miro] 22:49:59
This isn't something Dex can ask right now, because he doesn't want hacked over here, but is it possible to get anything out of Logic Course?

[GM] 22:50:09
Uh, is… get out of them, as far as… Yeah. Yeah, in fact.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:12
like…

[Dex Miro] 22:50:13
Like, memories of the person that the android they came out of.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:15
Yeah, location information…

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:19
the last 20 searches on Google,

[GM] 22:50:19
Um… you know… We're… Um… Murder actually knows full… full… Uh… that the logic core, like, if he were to replace this with somebody else as well, it would change his personality. He also would be able to upgrade.

[Ink] 22:50:26
Netflix history.

[GM] 22:50:39
potentially his skills and things.

[Ink] 22:50:45
I'm switching out logic wars. But he'd be gone then, right?

[GM] 22:50:47
Yeah. Yeah, but who cares about that if you get upgraded, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:48
But that would change the person, in essence, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:56
Uh…

[Ink] 22:50:56
I'm no more controlled by Carnoc.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:59
Well, that too…

[GM] 22:51:02
That's iffy. It would no longer be you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:02
But it would no longer be me!

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:06
What do I care?

[GM] 22:51:07
Yeah, what do you care?

[Ink] 22:51:08
Well, yeah, what is you? I mean, if you lose your arm and you replace your arms, is that still you?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:14
Yeah. Or is that the ship of Theseus?

[Dex Miro] 22:51:14
I mean, if it takes this larger car out and puts it on the shelf, then that's him, and he puts somebody else in his body.

[Ink] 22:51:14
I mean, what's Logic versus Yahoo?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:21
I mean, we can knock out Hank and switch it out with him, uh, okay. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:26
Wait, is this thing something I could do, like, an operation I could do on myself?

[GM] 22:51:31
Yeah, well, on yourself, no, you have to be powered down for that. You'll have to have somebody else do it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:31
Without anyone knowing?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:36
Oh, gotcha.

[Ink] 22:51:37
Do you really want the logic report from a dude that just hung himself?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:38
No, no, I'm… I was wondering what the process would be

[GM] 22:51:46
Yeah. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:51:48
Murder both spends 5 minutes on a thought experiment.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:51
Yeah, no, with my CPU, it was less than 2… a millisecond.

[Dex Miro] 22:51:59
Oh, okay, sorry.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:03
Us humans can't keep up with the speed of reasoning.

[GM] 22:52:05
Uh… Um, you…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:07
Um, I pocket the… I pocket it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:10
the Logic court and, uh, tell them, uh, yeah, it seems like, uh, the rope did it.

[GM] 22:52:24
Hank's like, uh-huh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, weirdo.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:26
Well, you know, you want to be thorough, you know, you can never be too sure.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:31
What? Why are you calling me a weirdo?

[GM] 22:52:32
That's fine. Just… Because… because you're over here… doing autopsies on guys who hung themselves, pretty clear.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:39
Hey, you gotta be thorough. You don't know if it was biological, if the guy was diseased, or if there was something else going on with his brain, or…

[GM] 22:52:48
Can we just move on?

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:50
Alright, fine.

[GM] 22:52:55
the, um… Hank says, the way to the.

[GM] 22:53:00
Um… which I'm gonna call it, the… the thing I hid is… Over to the left, we take a left out of that.

[GM] 22:53:10
that doorway, um… He's indicating, like, towards 22C.

[GM] 22:53:15
So, we go that way. you know, we'll get closer to it.

[Ink] 22:53:25
Alright, let's do it.

[GM] 22:53:29
Okay. Yeah, is that out of this room, head down the hall, down to 22C.

[GM] 22:53:34
Um, there's a elevator here.

[GM] 22:53:40
Uh, there's graffiti… On the walls around the elevator.

[GM] 22:53:49
Line 1. I dreamt I was a butterfly. Right, right below that.

[GM] 22:53:56
off with that. The line below that. My other right is a rubber… rubber lad?

[GM] 22:54:06
Uh… off to the side of that. Olham was here.

[GM] 22:54:11
And… kind of like… large and not completely circling all this is… Please, could you stop the noise?

[GM] 22:54:24
Um, Hank says, you gotta take the elevator down.

[Ink] 22:54:35
We're in 22D right now?

[GM] 22:54:39
22C.

[Ink] 22:54:42
Oh, so we didn't… we didn't go through… wait, how did we get to 22C?

[GM] 22:54:46
When he said left, he meant, like, he was, like, facing the doorway.

[Ink] 22:54:50
Okay, I see. So, we could have gone to the right and we didn't do 22DE, F, and G, then.

[GM] 22:54:51
Out of…

[GM] 22:54:56
Yeah, no, you didn't do any of that.

[Ink] 22:55:01
Yeah, there's nothing good in those rooms anyway.

[GM] 22:55:05
Huh?

[Ink] 22:55:10
And we gotta come through back this way anyway, so… Um, sure. Let's go down the elevator, I'm all in.

[GM] 22:55:17
Alright. Uh, you push the button. Um, takes a little while, but the elevator appears.

[GM] 22:55:25
Uh, guys, hop on the elevator. Push the button to go down. It only takes you down to the next floor, floor 2.

[GM] 22:55:33
Uh, as it begins to move, it begins to shriek.

[GM] 22:55:36
Horrendously. And. non-stop. It's like as if someone was taking a saw.

[GM] 22:55:45
To, like, the metal surroundings of the elevator. Everyone needs to make a sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:53
Everyone?

[GM] 22:55:54
Everyone.

[Ink] 22:55:54
Oh.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:56:01
Oh, I'll need it. Does he mean?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:56:04
Well, we're not to.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:10
Everyone fail.

[GM] 22:56:11
No, I saved. And so did Carnoc.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:56:13
That's it. weekly.

[GM] 22:56:16
Um, everybody else… Everybody else takes a point of stress.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:20
I'd say…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:56:24
Zeke did.

[GM] 22:56:25
Zoo… oh, yeah, Zeke's that's high. You got a high save there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:31
I'm very sane.

[Ink] 22:56:33
Wait, how did… Yeah, he got 73.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:35
Oh, you have to get less.

[GM] 22:56:37
Yeah, yeah, he got less. His target is 54, he got below, he got 50.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:41
How does he have less… more stress… less…

[Ink] 22:56:42
Oh, I was looking at strength. Nice.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:45
Oh, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:46
So is that… I should have… the high… okay.

[Ink] 22:56:54
Man, how is yours 50? That is crazy. That's because there's tiny intellect.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:58
Must be everything he knows about the world.

[GM] 22:57:05
Um, okay. Elevator doors open. You are all glad to be off of that thing, regardless of whether or not you were stressed out by it.

[GM] 22:57:14
Um… You're in 25A.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:17
So, uh… So what do we think the sound was? It's just old.

[GM] 22:57:22
just older and bad repair, or something like that.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:25
Well, I'm not in a hurry to get back in there.

[GM] 22:57:29
Um, alright, you're in a corporate luxury hotel lobby.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:33
Of course we are.

[GM] 22:57:34
Um… yeah, it's… it looks great in here. Uh… There's a heavily locked… airlock door to the south.

[GM] 22:57:48
Um, and then some… like a normal door to the east.

[GM] 22:58:02
there's, like, a fake plant in the room.

[Ink] 22:58:05
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:58:08
It's like the light fixtures are not just, like… LEDs in the ceiling, they're like.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:14
Your symptoms. So we're back to, like, clean-looking spots, no graffiti everywhere.

[GM] 22:58:15
Brass fixtures.

[GM] 22:58:20
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:58:25
Well, this is supposedly close to where the Minotaur's Labyrinth is.

[Ink] 22:58:29
you know, you're gonna get, uh, what's her name, excited, don't say that too loud.

[Ink] 22:58:39
There's gravity.

[GM] 22:58:41
Yes, there is gravity here.

[GM] 22:58:46
I will be right back.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:08
This station is super weird, man.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:13
What's up?

[Dex Miro] 22:59:16
This place is strange.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:17
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:32
That is an understatement.

[Ink] 22:59:54
But we didn't go to 22A either, did we?

[Ink] 23:00:01
Shoot.

[GM] 23:00:50
Alright, I'm back. Looks like other people are taking a break, though.

[Ink] 23:00:58
Who's missing?

[GM] 23:00:59
Dex is missing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:03
Dex is…

[GM] 23:01:14
I mean, we can keep going if you want.

[Ink] 23:02:55
That's always scary.

[GM] 23:02:55
Nothing. We're waiting for you.

[Dex Miro] 23:02:57
Oh, okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:26
So, can we see through either the airlock or the Dumbledore?

[Dex Miro] 23:03:30
Or they're both opaque.

[GM] 23:03:38
Um, the… airlock door is opaque, but the… towards the other one, has… kind of like… it's kind of opaque, it's, um… It definitely says, like, bathroom.

[GM] 23:03:52
Above the door.

[Dex Miro] 23:03:55
Okay.

[Ink] 23:03:59
So it's 25 beats the bathroom.

[GM] 23:04:06
Uh, 25B is a bathroom. Do you want to go in it?

[Ink] 23:04:10
Yeah, let's take the bathroom.

[GM] 23:04:13
Go into the bathroom. Uh, the bathroom is… smashed up. There's porcelain shards and heaps.

[GM] 23:04:24
on the wall, or, sorry, on the mirror. Uh, there's written in graffiti.

[GM] 23:04:31
the Minotaur extends beyond the Minotaur.

[GM] 23:04:37
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:38
What have you to say about that, Noriko?

[GM] 23:04:40
Uh, Noriko season, she claps. Giddily. She's laughing to herself, yeah!

[GM] 23:04:47
The minotaur does extend beyond the Minotaur.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:49
Ugh, this fucking bitch has lost it.

[Dex Miro] 23:04:52
So the Minotaur is infinite.

[GM] 23:04:52
Um…

[GM] 23:04:57
Uh… I mean… She thinks so.

[GM] 23:05:01
She's like, it's like love, man. Love is infinite.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:03
Oh, my God.

[GM] 23:05:07
Um, I'm… Yeah. I mean, so far, other than her shooting the gun into the ceiling, she seems like… Pretty much fine, you know?

[Dex Miro] 23:05:07
Didn't know the Rico was a hippie cultist.

[GM] 23:05:19
It just seems, like, pretty harmless. Um, on the ground is a cybernetic diagnostic scanner.

[Ink] 23:05:44
Cybernetic diagnostic scanner. Looks similar to our Android scanner, or something different?

[GM] 23:05:54
Um…

[GM] 23:05:58
It looks just like yours.

[Ink] 23:06:04
Well, I'm not carrying a radio pack anymore, so can I carry that now?

[GM] 23:06:08
Uh-huh, you pick it up.

[Ink] 23:06:11
It looked like it's operational, like… Non-brogan.

[GM] 23:06:15
You try to turn it on, it does not turn on.

[Ink] 23:06:17
He doesn't know can't spoke. Alright, push around this room, we know that there's an.

[Ink] 23:06:24
of ventilation shafts in this room?

[GM] 23:06:26
Yes, um… You… after you pick up the scanner, you see some screws on the ground, you look up.

[GM] 23:06:35
You see some… you see a ventilation shaft. Uh, that being said, sort of weirdly.

[GM] 23:06:40
Um… screws are in place in the ventilation shaft.

[GM] 23:06:45
These screws came from somewhere else.

[Ink] 23:06:47
Gotcha. Um, does it look like I can crawl through the ventilation chat?

[GM] 23:06:53
Maybe not while you're carrying this heavy. Broken, uh… scanner.

[Ink] 23:06:57
No, it's broke. It's broken anyway, so I'll put that… I'll put that down and, uh, unscrew the, uh… the screws, um, with, uh… I don't know, Murderbot's.

[GM] 23:07:01
Okay.

[Ink] 23:07:12
And nice.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:16
Well, it's

[GM] 23:07:16
Um… You look around, because there's these screws in the ground, you notice that there's a screwdriver next to the mirror.

[GM] 23:07:23
On the wall.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:28
I have a look at the mirror.

[GM] 23:07:31
You look at the mirror? Um, you noticed that some of the… Um, screws that were fixing the mirror to the wall are removed.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:33
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:07:45
But then you're still on the wall, or it's off the wall?

[GM] 23:07:47
It's on the wall.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:52
Can I try gently to remove it.

[GM] 23:07:55
Yeah. Uh, you kind of pried away from… the wall, um… it kind of begins to slip, but you catch it.

[GM] 23:08:05
Um… Behind it is sort of a secret.

[GM] 23:08:09
space? Um… In there, you see a custom rigging gun.

[GM] 23:08:18
It has a steel cord laced cable, um… Which is tied to, essentially, a battery pack.

[GM] 23:08:25
Meaning that you could fire this, uh. harpoon-type thing, uh, and then after it's been fired.

[GM] 23:08:33
electrically shock whatever it is hit. Essentially, yes, a very crude taser.

[Ink] 23:08:37
The taser.

[Dex Miro] 23:08:45
Is this something that requires training to operate, or…

[Dex Miro] 23:08:51
I'm basically asking if DEX would be any good editor, if he should give it to Carnoc.

[GM] 23:08:51
Uh…

[GM] 23:08:56
You'd be just as good as Karnak with this thing.

[GM] 23:09:00
In fact, maybe better. It's… It's… yeah, it's definitely… it's definitely not a firearm, so… as good as Karnak is with a gun, you're not sure that this thing is actually like.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:05
So, so Dex thinks anyway.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:10
Alright.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:15
Alright, do I have any way of telling if it's actually gonna work?

[GM] 23:09:20
Uh, you, like… power on the battery, batteries charged.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:25
Okay.

[GM] 23:09:26
Yeah. Uh, you see a note… sort of folded up next to a… 58… Next to a pair of eyes!

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:39
Ugh.

[Ink] 23:09:41
Oh, yeah. Once everything gets into the scanner room.

[Ink] 23:09:45
Oh, no, and then we…

[GM] 23:09:48
Their eyes just sitting there.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:51
Like, we're talking about actualized, not like Marvel's painted like that.

[GM] 23:09:54
a pair of eyeballs, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:56
Okay. Wow.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:02
Do I dare ask what the note says?

[GM] 23:10:05
Uh, do you open and read it?

[Dex Miro] 23:10:08
I mean, is it covered in blood? Then I guess I'll open it and read it.

[GM] 23:10:10
It is not covered in blood. The eyeballs, uh, actually.

[GM] 23:10:15
appear to be not covered in blood, really. uh, all the… not as much as you would expect.

[GM] 23:10:25
Uh… you read the note? It says, Ishmael sends the regards.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:27
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:35
Alright. Does that mean anything to anybody else?

[GM] 23:10:42
Uh, Hank says, nope.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:53
There seem to be several mythological and biblical references going on here.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:58
But I don't think anybody is an expert in that.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:02
Either in reality or our characters.

[GM] 23:11:12
Have you guys read Ishmael? That's a pretty good book.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:17
Does my linguistics training tell me anything about that? Probably not, it's not literature.

[GM] 23:11:22
No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:23
I got linguistics.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:26
What if we put two people with linguistics together?

[Dex Miro] 23:11:29
Then we could both not know it equally.

[GM] 23:11:32
Yeah. Then one of the two of you has read Ishmael, and you're like… maybe the eyes are about, like, opening up your eyes to.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:41
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:11:42
to secrets in the world.

[Ink] 23:11:52
Alright, can I try to crawl through the chat now?

[Dex Miro] 23:11:57
I guess Dex is gonna… it's like a backpack thing.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:02
With a gun, or just a gun?

[GM] 23:12:03
Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's… it's not… it doesn't take a… like, it requires both hands, um… And you could probably, like, clip the battery to your belt.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:08
Okay.

[GM] 23:12:13
Um, it's kind of like a harpoon gun otherwise.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:15
Okay. Alright, I'll take the… sorry, go ahead, Ink.

[GM] 23:12:16
Yeah. Alright, uh, you're gonna need a boost to… have someone boost you up there to get the, uh… thing unlocked.

[Ink] 23:12:24
Alright, everybody, give me a hand.

[Ink] 23:12:30
You like Murderbot? Can you give me a boost?

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:31
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:34
Yep.

[GM] 23:12:37
Okay, boost you up there. You start, um… Unscrewing the thing, eventually it pops off.

[GM] 23:12:45
Um… No, Rico is just kind of staring at the eyeballs.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:56
What do you see, Noriko?

[GM] 23:13:00
Um, don't they look shiny?

[Dex Miro] 23:13:04
I don't know, do I think they look abnormally shiny?

[GM] 23:13:09
Uh, you kind of, like… Oh, it's… there's lights in this room, um… you get a little bit closer to them, and you notice that the, um… Nerve endings, the optic nerves, off of the eyeball are actually metal.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:35
Okay. So, like… Biblical, like, human eyes, but they're not.

[GM] 23:13:40
Oh, they're… they're human eyes. Uh, but they also seem like they've been fused with this.

[GM] 23:13:46
sort of metal filaments.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:49
So it's like…

[Dex Miro] 23:13:55
Something metal took over the human. I mean, is this… can I show the optic nerve-ish thing to Zeke and see what he thinks?

[Ink] 23:14:04
Yeah, thank you. It's like a good fork.

[GM] 23:14:05
Oh, scientists, man, they need your science.

[Ink] 23:14:10
Good boy.

[GM] 23:14:14
Um… Zeke would tell you that, uh… These, much like the, uh, implements you have already gotten, or some form of, uh, cyberware.

[Ink] 23:14:29
Oh, so you can upgrade your eyes.

[GM] 23:14:32
Yeah, just to pull out the old ones.

[Ink] 23:14:37
I mean, might as well keep them, just in case.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:39
Would you have to shut down for that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:44
Uh-huh.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:44
Ah, yes, I would like to be unconscious for that.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:52
If I said no, would you just…

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:58
I was thinking of myself.

[GM] 23:15:09
Um, the air docked vent… uh, cover is off.

[GM] 23:15:13
And you could potentially shimmy up into it.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:19
Joseph, it's not weird, maybe I should take the ice.

[Ink] 23:15:19
My pleasure.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:22
I don't know.

[Ink] 23:15:24
Oh, in case you lose yours, you know.

[GM] 23:15:27
Noriko puts her hand on your shoulder and smiles at you and says, I don't think it's weird.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:33
So it is weird. Got it. Should I put that on as, like, a small item or something?

[GM] 23:15:40
Yeah, or actually, I mean, they're probably not even smaller, probably, like, tiny objects, so… Won't worry too much.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:45
Yeah, so I was calling, like, iMods or something.

[GM] 23:15:49
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:16:04
And then I'm gonna start crawling down the, uh… air shaft being here.

[GM] 23:16:08
Okay, to end up in 28A.

[GM] 23:16:17
Um… Uh, you get to the other side. Uh, it is dark in here.

[GM] 23:16:26
Um… though I think you're… shoulder lamb, um… or headlamp, or whatever… Wherever you had a flashlight on your previous suit is probably still working.

[GM] 23:16:38
Um, you kind of turn it on, and you kind of peer through the, uh, the grate.

[GM] 23:16:44
Um… in the room below… 25A.

[GM] 23:16:51
Wait, no, 28A, yeah. It's dark in here, yeah, okay.

[GM] 23:16:57
Um…

[GM] 23:17:03
You see a body lying on the floor. Its entire chest cavity.

[GM] 23:17:09
is… split open.

[GM] 23:17:15
you see something inside the chest cavity, but. It's unclear from this distance, and given, like, the grading and the lighting, it's not… you can't tell what it is.

[Ink] 23:17:26
Something inside the chest area. I can't tell what it is.

[GM] 23:17:33
Yeah. It's not moving.

[Ink] 23:17:33
It's not moving or anything.

[Ink] 23:17:41
Looks like an artifact.

[GM] 23:17:45
Maybe.

[Ink] 23:17:48
Okay, um, so I have to unscrew, like, can I pop off the grate and… lore myself into the room.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:57
So you didn't… you didn't do the… wait, this was a floor grade?

[GM] 23:17:57
Yeah, sure.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:02
I thought it was a ceiling grade. Okay. Oh, I see, you went up and then we were in the demo, okay.

[GM] 23:18:03
No, it's ceiling, it's AC duct. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:18:12
Now, if I hop down, I'm gonna be able to get backed up by myself.

[GM] 23:18:15
Not by yourself.

[Ink] 23:18:21
their stool or something is in them.

[GM] 23:18:26
Is there something you can stand on in here? Um… Small metallic chamber, uh, walls studded with.

[Ink] 23:18:28
Yeah.

[GM] 23:18:34
what appears to be, like. some sort of analysis equipment, maybe some scanning equipment, you're not sure.

[Ink] 23:18:45
inside the guy's chest. Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 23:18:46
No, no, no, these are on the walls. Um, but otherwise, there's nothing really to stand on.

[Ink] 23:18:53
Okay.

[Ink] 23:19:00
So, I… we can… we have comms, right? Okay, so I'm gonna ask the guys, if I lower down the room, can somebody come and lift me back up if I need to?

[GM] 23:19:03
Yeah.

[GM] 23:19:13
And then people start asking you, like, how are they gonna get out of there if they lift you up?

[Ink] 23:19:19
Well, they're gonna be up in the… in the grate, or their arms down, and then lifts down.

[GM] 23:19:22
Oh, yeah, okay. You're gonna jump up and grab their arms, and they're gonna be strong enough to pull you up.

[Ink] 23:19:24
That's what we're gonna do it.

[Ink] 23:19:30
I mean, it's murder… murder bot. Yeah.

[GM] 23:19:30
Absolutely.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:31
We're just gonna make a chain of people from one room to the other, and I can pull down, like.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:33
Why don't I go up for… aren't I the strongest? Actually, I don't…

[Ink] 23:19:38
Uh, I think Zeke is the strongest.

[Ink] 23:19:47
Actually, I put a lot in strength, although I put the motion speed, because I thought we'd just be running away from aliens all the time.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:54
Hold on, what's my strength at?

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:57
I've had 35.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:00
Oh, damn!

[Ink] 23:20:00
I got 45 stream.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:03
Well, stop.

[Ink] 23:20:06
Owl department of pushing doors.

[GM] 23:20:15
So you're dropping down in there?

[Ink] 23:20:18
Uh, yeah, let me drop down in there.

[GM] 23:20:20
Okay. You drop down. It's not terribly far, um… you stick the landing, you're fine.

[GM] 23:20:30
Um… Yeah, you see… something crudely shoved into this.

[GM] 23:20:38
chest cavity of this body.

[Ink] 23:20:46
I can examine it closer.

[GM] 23:20:49
They're gonna try and pull it out of the body.

[Ink] 23:20:52
Um… now that I'm closer to it, can I see anything else? Like, is it gonna bite me and blow up? I don't know.

[GM] 23:21:01
Oh, it's not organic. Uh, looks metallic in nature, it's like a little… Like, the… Yeah.

[Ink] 23:21:08
But it looks like it's stashed in the body, like somebody put it in there to hide it.

[Ink] 23:21:12
Not like they killed the person with it. Okay, sure.

[GM] 23:21:14
No.

[GM] 23:21:19
You pull it out. Alright, uh… Two small black boxes with universal ports.

[Ink] 23:21:20
Yeah.

[GM] 23:21:29
They're kind of, uh, wrapped together.

[Ink] 23:21:38
These small black boxes. Okay, so I gotta put those, like, my backpack.

[Ink] 23:21:42
Correct. Can you analyze it later?

[GM] 23:21:45
Sorry, what'd you say? Sure.

[Ink] 23:21:47
I put those in my backpack for Zeke to analyze later.

[GM] 23:21:53
Um, make a speed check.

[GM] 23:22:10
Okay. Um… you gain a stress, you feel like someone's watching you.

[Ink] 23:22:26
Right, so I have 3 potential exits from here, 20B.

[Ink] 23:22:30
And then a hallway 28A to 25C.

[Ink] 23:22:37
And the room's dark enough that I can't see, potentially, everybody inside the room.

[GM] 23:22:43
Oh, what do you mean you can't see everyone inside the room?

[Ink] 23:22:45
if there was somebody in the room watching me.

[Ink] 23:22:47
I would not… they may be hiding in the darkness of the room.

[GM] 23:22:51
No. You got pretty good light on your, uh, whatchamacallit, that you could probably…

[Ink] 23:22:56
Okay, so I feel like I'm being watched, but not by somebody that's physically in the room with me.

[GM] 23:23:01
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:02
When you say metallic, do you mean there's any mirrors?

[GM] 23:23:09
There's any mirrors?

[Dex Miro] 23:23:10
Like, on the walls in this room, because you said it was a small metallic chamber.

[GM] 23:23:16
Oh, um…

[GM] 23:23:19
No, no mirrors. Um… yeah, the… there's some… Uh, in the, um… the… there's, like, essentially a big pipe.

[GM] 23:23:38
in the base of this floor, um, that you think is the thing that will connect you to 25C.

[GM] 23:23:43
Um, but there's a bunch of stuff blocking it.

[Ink] 23:23:47
Oh, so I can't go from here 25C.

[GM] 23:23:50
You might be able to, you might just have to do that stuff out.

[Ink] 23:23:54
And she gets a pint, so it has to go down.

[GM] 23:23:58
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:24:01
And what about for 28B?

[GM] 23:24:02
Uh, 28B is just a door.

[Ink] 23:24:20
Okay, so… We have two ways of getting through the… the lift… is that a lift or a duct that goes between… that's a… that's a duct, right, that goes between 27A and… Floor 3.1.

[GM] 23:24:38
Uh, 27A, let me just check.

[Ink] 23:24:42
Yeah, that's it. Okay, it's done, because it has a square on it, so there's a duct we have to crawl through to get through that.

[GM] 23:24:48
Uh, it is not, uh, ducked. It's like an elevator.

[Ink] 23:24:49
Um…

[Ink] 23:24:53
Oh, really? 31A? Yeah.

[GM] 23:24:54
from 27A to… 31A? Yeah.

[Ink] 23:24:58
That's an elevator. Okay.

[GM] 23:25:00
Yeah. Or, or, yeah, maybe it's not… no, it's not an elevator, sorry.

[GM] 23:25:09
Um…

[Ink] 23:25:11
It's got squares, so it's a ventilation shaft.

[GM] 23:25:15
Kind of. It's a… it's maintenance access, is what the name of the… Thing is.

[Ink] 23:25:19
Okay. So a little bit… maybe a little bit bigger than what I crawled through to get to.

[GM] 23:25:23
Right, right.

[GM] 23:25:28
Oh, you figured out what the, uh… The symbols are for maintenance shift.

[Ink] 23:25:33
Yeah, there's… there's squares for ducks. And triangles for lifts.

[Ink] 23:25:38
between the dotted lines, the dotted lines are a little bit smaller.

[Ink] 23:25:41
For the ducks.

[Ink] 23:25:45
I can see the key in the bottom right-hand corner, if you… I'm not… I'm not just me, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not the… Not that… not that, yeah. Decoded, yes.

[GM] 23:25:45
Mm, mm-hmm. Oh, oh, okay. Oh, I didn't even realize that was down there.

[GM] 23:25:53
That's okay. I was like… I was like… I was very impressed, because I was like, I don't even see those symbols on my sheet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:56
Like, damn, boy!

[GM] 23:26:01
And I'm looking at my handbook that I'm holding, versus, like, the actual screen on my computer.

[Ink] 23:26:07
Yeah. The bottom right-hand corner you gave us the key.

[GM] 23:26:10
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Um, cool.

[Ink] 23:26:18
Um, okay, so… I guess I have comms with you guys, so the… One passage we have is to go this direction through 28B.

[Ink] 23:26:27
through the gutter, is what it sounds… which sounds… I don't know, yeah, I mean, can't be any worse than right?

[Ink] 23:26:36
Um… But we know the Minotaur is on Floor 2.

[Ink] 23:26:43
And… and the Minotaur's in a labyrinth. I generally think of labyrinths.

[Ink] 23:26:49
Like, mazes, right, and, like, a garden type of maze, and so then there's the garden, and so… to me, the Minotaur might be 25.

[Ink] 23:26:58
F ore in the gutter, I guess are the two places that I'm… Suspecting to find the Minotaur.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:07
And there's so many places with no name, it's hard to say.

[Ink] 23:27:10
Yeah. So those specifically have… those areas. Um… We need to get to for… we need to put a radio on this floor, don't we, GM Hunt?

[Dex Miro] 23:27:11
Well.

[GM] 23:27:26
Uh, you need to put one on… Floor 2, yes.

[Ink] 23:27:31
Okay, so we need to find a place to play radio here.

[Ink] 23:27:33
Somewhere. Um, actually, I suggest that you put a radio behind the, uh, the mirror and replace the mirror.

[Dex Miro] 23:27:40
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

[GM] 23:27:43
Okay.

[Ink] 23:27:44
So, I don't have a radio, Dex doesn't have a radio anymore, we've deployed ours.

[Ink] 23:27:49
Ellie's Zeke, and Carnoc that have radios.

[GM] 23:27:52
Which one of you wants to unload your radio?

[Dex Miro] 23:27:58
Um, I guess I could… Try to set up Zeke's radio transmitter.

[GM] 23:28:05
Is that okay with Zeke? Or is he asleep?

[GM] 23:28:15
Alright. We'll assume Zeke's okay with that.

[Ink] 23:28:21
Release Zeke?

[GM] 23:28:24
I mean, interesting part is that he's un-muted. But…

[Ink] 23:28:38
That makes it all wrong, and it's nice, fine.

[GM] 23:28:39
Mm-hmm. Maybe Hank got him.

[Ink] 23:28:45
Not all worried about Jim.

[GM] 23:28:48
Hmm. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:54
Miguel, where are you, Miguel?

[GM] 23:29:04
Maybe I'll wake up in a second.

[GM] 23:29:13
Right, which direction you head…

[Ink] 23:29:14
Weird. Um… I guess… I guess I'll start to clear off 28.

[Ink] 23:29:25
8 to 25C. So that I could use that passageway if I wanted to, while they're setting up the radio.

[GM] 23:29:32
Hold on a second, I got… hold on one second.

[Ink] 23:29:49
So we lose… we lost… I don't know, we lost Zeke, maybe. Um…

[Ink] 23:29:56
So we… we have maybe 4 objectives left. Right now.

[Ink] 23:30:02
once we finish deploying this radio, we need to get another radio on floor 3.

[Ink] 23:30:06
It'd be nice if we found them that it's our.

[Ink] 23:30:09
And then potentially dispatch to the Minotaur, right?

[Ink] 23:30:17
Um… and once we hit 43, we can call in lesser names that come to the station.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:27
Um… What was the other thing we had to do before we could wait a few hours?

[Ink] 23:30:34
we have to get to Floor 3. We have to get to Floor 3 and camp out.

[Dex Miro] 23:30:34
For somebody to show up. It's just getting there, there wasn't something else we had to do.

[Ink] 23:30:39
Yep. No, I think we did… we deploy four… the four radios, and then get to floor 3 with my environment.

[Ink] 23:30:45
what I remember. But that was our missions from what a Commander Kilroy.

[Ink] 23:30:51
from, um… From, uh, what's the… what's the guy that's running the station here? Not… not her.

[Ink] 23:30:59
The, uh… the artificial intelligence front of the station, we need to get.

[Ink] 23:31:03
Kilroy, and get rid of Minotaur would be the two things, but Kilroy's the number one objective.

[Ink] 23:31:11
If we get rid of Kilroy, then we get, um, the economic model.

[Ink] 23:31:15
Or at least give away some biological sample and brain scan.

[GM] 23:31:27
Alright, I'm back. Um… You begin clearing some stuff off, you pull the, uh.

[GM] 23:31:33
sewer grate, you… climb down into the pipe.

[GM] 23:31:37
It's like, um, you kind of have to bend over.

[GM] 23:31:41
Um, but it's not… you don't have to crawl.

[GM] 23:31:43
Um, but you have to kind of, like, squat, walk.

[GM] 23:31:47
Uh, and it stinks in here. Um, you squat walk for a little while.

[GM] 23:31:53
You come across a, um… pile of stinking filth that blocks the entire thing.

[GM] 23:32:01
That being said, you could dig through it. Um…

[Ink] 23:32:04
And that's, like, blocking me from getting to 25C.

[GM] 23:32:09
Yes. Um… it's… it's movable.

[Ink] 23:32:11
a Palestinian filth.

[GM] 23:32:14
Mostly organic waste. Um… but it's… horrendous stench.

[Ink] 23:32:21
Gotcha.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:22
Excuse me.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:29
So this is an event, or a…

[Ink] 23:32:31
I went down to, like, a sewer hatch 28A to go… that leads me to 25C.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:36
Oh, so we're green, okay.

[Ink] 23:32:37
And ran into, uh… ran into a pile of.

[Ink] 23:32:45
Alright, so have they set… have they set up a radio yet, GM?

[GM] 23:32:50
Yeah, they set it up.

[Ink] 23:32:52
can I go back and look through the door in 28B?

[GM] 23:32:57
Uh, yeah, you go back, uh, you look through the door in 28B.

[GM] 23:33:02
Um, it's a passageway of grinding machinery and gears.

[GM] 23:33:08
Um… As you open the door, the rumbling gets quite a bit louder.

[GM] 23:33:15
Um…

[Ink] 23:33:17
This is an industrial size room, I guess it's bigger.

[GM] 23:33:20
Yeah, it's a big room. Um… that's kind of just what you see from the doorway.

[Ink] 23:33:28
Uh, so that passageway tunnels. Alright, so I guess I propose that we… That would go through the gutter.

[Ink] 23:33:38
And if we don't encounter… the Minotaur through the gutter, then we… track back to the garden?

[Ink] 23:33:51
I'm asking over comms, I guess.

[Ink] 23:33:58
Everybody's asleep.

[Ink] 23:34:04
Karen, are you with me? Perfect. How's this?

[GM] 23:34:07
Am I with you? Oh, Carnoc, okay. He's awake.

[Ink] 23:34:12
I can see him on. You know, go to the gutter with me?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:34:12
I'm here.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:18
I don't know what the gutter is.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:34:18
Sure, I'll go with it.

[GM] 23:34:23
It's the, uh, line that connects 28. A to 25C.

[Ink] 23:34:24
To the nicest place in the state.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:27
Yeah, that's also all I know about it.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:37
Wait… wait. 2825C.

[Ink] 23:34:40
28D is what is labeled the gutter on the map.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:41
No, that's not the gutter, there's a thing that's actually labeled the gutter.

[GM] 23:34:44
Oh, oh, sorry. I didn't… I didn't realize that that's what the map.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:48
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it does seem like a reasonable name for it.

[GM] 23:34:48
I was thinking of this waste pipe as a gutter, sorry.

[Ink] 23:34:50
Yeah, it does kind of seem like a guy. No, no.

[Ink] 23:34:54
Yeah. I want to go through 20. I want to go through 28B, so I… I suggest the other guys come through.

[Ink] 23:35:01
this event and go through 28B with me.

[GM] 23:35:04
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:04
Was there a reason that we hated the airlock? I don't remember what it looked like.

[GM] 23:35:07
it's locked.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:09
I guess we… oh. So we'd have to apply… Inc. Usual master key.

[Ink] 23:35:16
Yeah.

[GM] 23:35:16
Uh, it is digitally. Marked.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:21
Oh.

[Ink] 23:35:23
Digits still burn, right? Oh, so you're suggesting I wouldn't be able to burn through it.

[GM] 23:35:25
Huh? True. Yeah, no. It's got a little keypad.

[Ink] 23:35:32
Okay, well, I would suggest further that we, uh… go this… go this direction, then.

[GM] 23:35:34
Me…

[GM] 23:35:43
Alright. For those people who are present in the game.

[GM] 23:35:49
Do you agree to that? Okay. Alright, uh… the party forms a bit of a… Boost and lift, uh, to get people through the.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:49
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:51
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:53
Yeah.

[GM] 23:36:02
AC vents, um… Who's the last one up?

[GM] 23:36:11
I have to get pulled. Inc… what's that?

[Ink] 23:36:12
Spring hang-up last. We'll bring Hank up last.

[GM] 23:36:17
Hank, okay. Hank's fine with that. He doesn't mind being last.

[GM] 23:36:22
Alright, you guys all shim me through and drop down into the other room.

[GM] 23:36:26
It's a little disgusting that there's that body there, but, you know, that's… That seems fine. Um… you go… you're going through 28B then?

[GM] 23:36:39
Is that right? Okay. Uh… You're walking through 28B. There's all these gears and grinding and stuff, um… And then, uh… you guys see on the ground, um… Near one of these gears and stuff.

[Ink] 23:36:40
Sorry, I have lost the, uh… Yes. Yeah, 20.

[GM] 23:36:59
a revolver. Um, and an electronic toolkit.

[GM] 23:37:06
Um…

[GM] 23:37:11
Hank's like, cool! He, like, runs over to grab the revolver.

[GM] 23:37:16
Um… And as he picks up the gun, you guys notice that in and amongst the gears.

[GM] 23:37:26
is a corpse being smashed and continually, like… Uh, squished by the gears. It's, like, caught up in the teeth of the gears.

[GM] 23:37:34
Everyone needs to make a fear save.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:45
Oh my god, I succeeded.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:50
I did not.

[GM] 23:37:52
No, critically failed Murderbot. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:53
What?!

[Ink] 23:37:56
Oh, man, I didn't tee my pants either.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:57
Someone inspire me.

[GM] 23:38:02
Um… Does anything happen when an Android fails a fear save? What's your… what's the bad?

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:02
This is messed up.

[GM] 23:38:08
thing that happens. Uh, let's see…

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:11
How do I look that up?

[Ink] 23:38:14
like C3PO stuff.

[GM] 23:38:16
Murder bot… B2. Oh, it's not in here.

[GM] 23:38:22
Damn it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:28
I'm at a level 8 stress right now, though.

[GM] 23:38:34
Android. Fear saves made by a close. Friendly players are at disadvantage.

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:40
Wait, what?

[Murderbot V2] 23:38:43
Say that again?

[GM] 23:38:45
Take note of your class's trauma response, Android, fear saves made by close, friendly players are at disadvantage, so technically, everyone should have made a.

[GM] 23:38:55
made their fear save at disadvantage. Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:38:59
Really? I guess.

[Ink] 23:39:00
Because you're buying Android?

[Murderbot V2] 23:39:02
That's… crazy.

[GM] 23:39:04
Meanwhile, uh… Teamsters have, once per session, you may make.

[GM] 23:39:10
may take advantage on a panic check. Scientist is, whenever you fail a sanity save, all close, friendly players gain 1 stress.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:14
Okay.

[GM] 23:39:20
And the marine is, whenever you panic, every close, friendly player must make a fear save.

[GM] 23:39:26
So… Yeah. Anyways, uh, I'm not gonna make you guys re-roll.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:27
Yeah, that one we've done before.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:39:29
Ah, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:34
Okay.

[GM] 23:39:34
Uh, but we know that now. Okay. Um… Let's see… um…

[Dex Miro] 23:39:40
So what happened?

[Ink] 23:39:43
You guys are grinding in the gears.

[GM] 23:39:53
Uh, something about… the fact that Hank now has a weapon?

[GM] 23:39:58
triggers Murderbot, uh… to go full-on, uh, kill mode.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:10
Hank is gonna go…

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:12
full-on kill mode right now?

[GM] 23:40:14
Yeah, he's gonna try and kill you.

[Ink] 23:40:16
U.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:17
Oh, my fucking god.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:19
Good. But, like, he's actually doing it, or Murderbot just thinks that it is gonna murder him.

[GM] 23:40:27
I mean, he's picking that gun up, and it looks like he's pointing it at Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:31
Alright, go and tackle him.

[GM] 23:40:33
Okay. You can show them the gears?

[Ink] 23:40:34
So many years.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:39
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:40:40
That should be awful. Don't do that. No, don't do that, don't do that.

[GM] 23:40:41
Did you look at the gears?

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:42
Yeah, so…

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:44
Don't do that? I was just gonna wrestle them down to the ground.

[Ink] 23:40:46
No, no, no, no, he's one of, uh, what's his name's children.

[Ink] 23:40:51
don't… don't… don't fuck him up.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:54
This is gonna take him down to the ground, but if the gears are there, then…

[GM] 23:40:57
I mean, they are there. You wanna just put, like, his hand in there to make sure it doesn't, you know…

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:01
I tried to knock the gun into the gears, how about that?

[GM] 23:41:05
Okay, okay.

[Ink] 23:41:08
No, no, we want to keep the gun. It's a matter of fact.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:08
Okay, I knocked… I knocked… I knocked the gun toward… toward, uh, Ink, and I…

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:17
I tackle him down to the ground.

[GM] 23:41:19
Okay. Uh, he's screaming, what the Get off me! What are you doing?

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:23
You're trying to kill us, motherfucker!

[GM] 23:41:25
I'm not trying to kill you, you're trying to kill me right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:27
No, we're not trying to kill you! You're trying to kill us!

[GM] 23:41:30
You are… Um… Well, he's no longer armed.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:37
take the revolver away? You did? Okay.

[GM] 23:41:38
He doesn't… he doesn't seem to be a threat anymore.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:42
I pull a zip tie from my pack, and I zip tie his hands and legs together.

[GM] 23:41:47
Okay. What… what are you doing?

[Ink] 23:41:49
Because he can't win on carrying. We don't want to carry him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:50
Huh?

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:54
Just making sure you're not a harm to us, or a danger to us, or a danger to yourself.

[GM] 23:42:02
Uh, Noriko says, we should bring him to the Minotaur. The Minotaur will bring him peace.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:07
Apparently, this minotaur thing's gonna bring you peace.

[GM] 23:42:11
He's like, what the man? I just… I thought I found a cool gun, and… Tackling me and.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:18
Yeah, you were gonna shoot at us!

[GM] 23:42:20
I wasn't gonna shoot at you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:22
Yes, you were.

[GM] 23:42:25
No, it wasn't. I swear it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:27
Do you swear?

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:30
Do you pinky swear?

[GM] 23:42:32
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:34
All right. Well, I do… I undo the zip ties to his legs, and I… I prop…

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:40
prop them up.

[GM] 23:42:41
Against the gears. Oh, I was really hoping for that one. That one was gonna be my favorite.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:42
No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:45
Not because of gears.

[Ink] 23:42:46
No!

[Ink] 23:42:51
Hmm.

[GM] 23:42:53
He just gets pulled right in, just murdered.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:56
I don't know, like the… like the little, uh, remainder of the zip tie just sucks them right in.

[GM] 23:43:02
Yeah. Real slow to it, but you're just staring in horror as you just get sucked in.

[GM] 23:43:11
Uh, yeah, alright, you prop them up. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:13
Look, doesn't know he was gonna shoot at us?

[Dex Miro] 23:43:20
Um, it'll happen pretty fast.

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:23
Well, my millisecond of computation and decision-making

[GM] 23:43:24
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:30
led to this…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:32
So…

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:35
He was totally gonna shoot at us, guys!

[GM] 23:43:38
He seemed likely to shoot you.

[Ink] 23:43:42
As I do stop him. He's unarmed now, and you're okay.

[GM] 23:43:47
Okay. He's… he seems a bit disgruntled, but he otherwise does not complain much more about being.

[Ink] 23:43:52
Uh, what?

[GM] 23:43:57
have his hands zip-tied. Noriko's comforting him by patting him on the shoulder and telling him all about the Minotaur, and the Minotaur will bring him peace.

[Ink] 23:44:06
Um, how about we check up the electronic toolkit? Who's best equipped to use that?

[GM] 23:44:17
Anyone with, like, either electronic skill or computer skill, maybe?

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:20
I got computer skill.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:24
My computer skill has been very…

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:26
Very bad lately, but we can go with it.

[GM] 23:44:33
Okay. No, just to have an electronic toolkit now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:34
What overall?

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:37
Oh, okay. I use the electronic toolkit.

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:43
Whenever we need it.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:45
So, what about the corpse that's actually stuck in the gears?

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:48
You'll pull it out.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:51
Like, does it look like it's been there a while?

[GM] 23:44:57
Uh… yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:01
But the gears are still, like… Trying to…

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:02
Moving?

[GM] 23:45:06
This part of the fear save is the fact that these, uh… Body bits have been, you know, thoroughly mushed.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:13
Okay. Yup.

[GM] 23:45:14
It's like… yeah, it's like the head… you can't really see a face or anything, but, like, the hair on top of the head is kind of, like, still attached to the gear and looks, like, kind of like a wig stuck in it, but you're…

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:27
Ugh.

[GM] 23:45:27
You know, that's not a wig.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:31
I mean… do I think I could remove it without… Making things worse.

[GM] 23:45:38
like, pull the body out? Yeah, you could get it out. The gears don't turn very fast.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:40
Yeah.

[GM] 23:45:46
Um, so yeah, you could… you could pull it out.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:49
Alright.

[Ink] 23:45:50
Hey, Hank, does that look like Jim?

[GM] 23:45:53
Uh, no, that's, like, blonde curly hair. Jim's got black straight hair.

[GM] 23:45:59
Don't you remember? I told you what he looked like.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:01
Or stuck in the gears, still not good.

[Ink] 23:46:01
Oh, I didn't… I didn't know what the gear guy looked like.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:08
Alright, guess I'm gonna try to… Remove the corpse from the gears.

[GM] 23:46:14
Yeah, you pull it out.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:18
Well, it doesn't require, like, another fear save or anything.

[GM] 23:46:21
It's gross, you've already experienced the grossness.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:25
Did I… did I get blood on my spammer?

[GM] 23:46:29
Do you want to get blood on your spanner?

[Dex Miro] 23:46:30
I was… No.

[GM] 23:46:33
Okay. then you do a pretty good job. Most of the blood is, like, dried up at this point.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:37
Okay.

[GM] 23:46:38
It's not like a… it's been a… it's been long enough that the blood's dried.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:42
Okay.

[GM] 23:46:42
You're mostly pulling out, like, essentially a… Uh, extremely beat-up suit with some, um, bone fragments inside.

[GM] 23:46:53
Uh, along with, like, a. partial scalp of hair.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:57
Okay, so it's… The face is not super recognizable, is what I'm getting.

[GM] 23:47:05
Yes, that's true. Um… the suit that it wears, though, is not unlike… the suit of the hanged corpse.

[GM] 23:47:16
Um… on the sleeve, there's a patch that says verified human.

[GM] 23:47:41
Actually, Ink, I wasn't… when I was saying that… Didn't I tell you what the guy looked like? I was actually speaking as.

[GM] 23:47:47
Hank. Who was it? Okay. I was like, I wasn't reprimanding you.

[Ink] 23:47:48
Yeah, no, you're good. No, it was good. I… no, I just had thought I missed it earlier, or something like that. I was like, oh.

[Ink] 23:47:57
No, you're good. I like that.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:01
And I, uh… Can I scan the corpse and see if it's actually a human?

[GM] 23:48:09
Uh, yeah. You spend some time… Um, Scan Corpse… From what you can tell.

[GM] 23:48:17
of the parts that are here, they're all human.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:27
Oh. And verified and re-verified.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:48:28
I've been experiencing.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:34
human.

[GM] 23:48:35
Hmm.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:38
But I guess we found before… It doesn't take much to be an android.

[GM] 23:48:48
No.

[Dex Miro] 23:48:50
Okay, so… That wallet.

[GM] 23:49:01
So the weird thing is, on the big map here, it looks like there's… lines from 28B to both 28C and 28D?

[Dex Miro] 23:49:13
Yeah.

[GM] 23:49:14
But on mine, like, the smaller map that I have.

[GM] 23:49:18
It shows only 28B to 28C.

[GM] 23:49:25
And then 28C connects to 28D and 29A.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:32
It does feel… it does feel oddly connected for something called the gutter.

[Ink] 23:49:32
So let's just go to 28…

[Ink] 23:49:38
Well, let's check out 2018 next, then.

[GM] 23:49:41
Okay, guys go to 28C. Uh, he passed through the door, you go down the hallway, um, then you see a series of tunnels open up.

[GM] 23:49:50
28C is a small chamber that leads into them. It's dusty and forgotten.

[GM] 23:49:56
Um…

[GM] 23:50:00
Uh, before going into the, uh, series of tunnels.

[GM] 23:50:05
There's a bulkhead door. to 20… that's what leads to 28D.

[GM] 23:50:14
Um, next to… Um, the bulkhead door… You see childish murals depicting piles of androids being torn to pieces.

[GM] 23:50:27
burned and shot by unseen assailants. Above the piles are people being led from a steel cave into tunnels by a benevolent steel hand.

[Ink] 23:50:42
What does, uh, our… female friend think of this, what's her name?

[GM] 23:50:51
Uh, Noriko? Noriko thinks that the benevolent steel hand is clearly the hand of the Minotaur.

[Ink] 23:50:52
Yeah, there you go.

[Ink] 23:50:58
Okay, let's right.

[GM] 23:51:03
She says, see? The mentor's saving all of those people. Isn't it wonderful?

[Ink] 23:51:09
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:51:24
Um, so anything… else in this room that would look like we could… so we… It's of interest?

[GM] 23:51:32
Mmm, no.

[Ink] 23:51:45
Um, I guess 28D.

[GM] 23:51:48
Okay, you open up the bulkhead. Um, you walk into a room, uh, there's a 20-meter pit in the.

[GM] 23:51:59
Duck. Which leads down, uh… How far is 20 meters, that's like 60 feet.

[Ink] 23:52:07
Man.

[GM] 23:52:08
Um…

[Dex Miro] 23:52:11
Yeah.

[GM] 23:52:21
Okay, I'm kind of failing to understand how this is constructed, but… leads down to a shantytown of deposed androids.

[GM] 23:52:31
Says they're androids. Um… There's dangling cables and corroded sheets of metal.

[GM] 23:52:36
Um, it's basically a sewer. Um… at the bottom, you see… a bunch of androids, all damaged and crudely repaired.

[GM] 23:52:53
Um… They're kind of bumping into each other.

[GM] 23:52:58
not really the sort of ambling. Um, ambling and rambling.

[Ink] 23:53:08
So it doesn't look like we can go through here to get to 298 without going down that shaft.

[GM] 23:53:14
No, you can get to 29A from going into the tunnels, uh, but it looks like maybe if you go down, drop down this… 60-foot drop, um, it probably connects to the tunnels as well.

[Ink] 23:53:27
Okay, but they look pretty much stuck, and they're not doing anything.

[GM] 23:53:31
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:53:39
Alright, I see we check out 298.

[GM] 23:53:42
Okay. You head into the tunnels. Uh, it's a bird's nest tangle of wet suit of flesh lined tunnels.

[GM] 23:53:50
So all the walls look like they're covered in skin.

[GM] 23:53:55
Um, but you test out one of your purple beads to find out that it's actually.

[GM] 23:53:59
Fake skin. Um… there are corridors of pipes and scaffolding.

[Ink] 23:54:02
Hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:04
Oh…

[GM] 23:54:07
Um…

[GM] 23:54:13
Oh, there's a word. They're constantly shuddering and shifting in peristalsis.

[GM] 23:54:23
Um… As you guys are, like, kind of testing out or, like, maybe trip and fall and touch the walls.

[GM] 23:54:31
Uh, the pseudo flesh, uh, it becomes, like, red and… blotchy, as if, um… Like, it's got, uh, hives.

[GM] 23:54:41
Um, the only one it doesn't, uh… react to is Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:47
Huh?

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:51
I did what now?

[Ink] 23:54:54
It doesn't react to you, the fleshy wall.

[Murderbot V2] 23:54:57
No, I wonder why. What about Hank?

[GM] 23:55:01
Oh, it doesn't react for him either.

[Ink] 23:55:01
Oh, that's good. That's what you call it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:04
Yeah, I figured.

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:07
Hey, Hank, go running down!

[Murderbot V2] 23:55:15
What do you guys wanna do?

[Ink] 23:55:19
Uh, proceed to 26C.

[GM] 23:55:23
Okay. Um, as you're walking along… Uh, let's see, how long does it take you?

[GM] 23:55:29
Oops.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:43
Wait, so the… the shuttering and shifting and peristalsis was the… Walls or the androids?

[GM] 23:55:50
the walls, because you guys are in the tunnels right now.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:52
Okay.

[GM] 23:55:57
Um, you're walking along, and then suddenly… the pseudo-flesh, the skin walls, uh… go from being skin.

[GM] 23:56:09
to glistening, dripping tongues. As you pass by, the way that you've noticed this is that they reach out to.

[GM] 23:56:18
to lick you. No, no.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:21
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:24
So this is before we get to 29A, or this is 29A?

[GM] 23:56:28
This is kind of 29A. 29 days is quite large.

[GM] 23:56:34
just kind of an adventure in, uh, this one.

[GM] 23:56:38
begins to understand is it's a labyrinth.

[GM] 23:56:45
Uh, shortly after the tongues, though, you come across, um… a bright open chamber.

[GM] 23:56:51
It's covered in geometric designs. Uh, and it feels… sort of like a, uh, like, there's not, like, skin covering the walls or tongues covering the walls or anything.

[GM] 23:57:03
Uh, there's 15 people here. Um, and they run up to you and eagerly greet you.

[GM] 23:57:11
Um… Noriko says, these are people touched by the Minotaur, you can tell. Look how happy they are.

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:21
Uh…

[GM] 23:57:21
Um, they all cry out, yes, the Minotaur saved us!

[GM] 23:57:24
made us whole again. Minotaur is wonderful and peaceful being.

[Ink] 23:57:31
So we're still in 29A.

[GM] 23:57:31
Um… Yes.

[GM] 23:57:37
Um…

[GM] 23:57:42
So… all these people kind of gather around you, and they're… they're kind of… Like, touching you, um… greeting you, uh, they're… overly friendly.

[GM] 23:57:57
Um, and they're… you know, just kind of, once Enrico mentioned the Minotaur, they're… they shifted.

[GM] 23:58:06
To just, like, that's all they want to talk about.

[GM] 23:58:09
Um… And then, uh… you hear this sort of high-pitched… it's not really a roar, because roars are often, uh… it's not a squeal.

[GM] 23:58:25
Was this, like… sort of warning shout of some kind.

[GM] 23:58:30
And I will direct your attention to the… Bottom… left.

[GM] 23:58:40
the screen.

[GM] 23:58:44
Yep. It crawls out of the darkness towards you.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:44
Like the…

[GM] 23:58:53
Um… Scott, if you can zoom in, it's got, like, mouths on its back.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:59:02
Yeah, what is it?

[Ink] 23:59:02
What the heck that is.

[GM] 23:59:04
Yeah. Uh, and… Everyone needs to make a panic check.

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:10
No!

[GM] 23:59:11
So you roll a D20.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:13
Wait, what was my special thing about panics?

[GM] 23:59:17
Uh, your special thing is… you get to roll it with Advantage, I think, once a day?

[GM] 23:59:23
Once per session.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:24
Alright, seems like a good time for that. Wow.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:29
Oh, it even says that right on my character sheet. Okay.

[Ink] 23:59:33
We just roll a 1D10 for our panic shift?

[GM] 23:59:34
1 to… 1 to 20. You're trying to roll, I think, above?

[Ink] 23:59:37
For this one.

[Ink] 23:59:42
No, he never wrote above anything else.

[GM] 23:59:43
Your stress level? No, whatever your stress is at.

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:44
above a 1?

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:49
No, above 1?

[GM] 23:59:51
Mm-hmm. Where's Panic at?

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:52
Fuck.

[Ink] 23:59:57
I burned my, uh, Advantage too for this.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:58
There's no panic on the sheet.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:00:01
Are you trying to roll below your stress?

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:04
Ha ha!

[GM] 00:00:05
Oh, here we go, pan check. Make panic, roll panic die, and attempt to roll greater than your current stress.

[GM] 00:00:12
Alright, Murderbot. You become overwhelmed.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:12
Ah, come on, man.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:18
I become overwhelmed.

[GM] 00:00:20
Yeah, you become overwhelmed. Um… Just, uh… you have disadvantage on all rolls for the next 1D-10 minutes.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:21
What does that mean?

[GM] 00:00:30
Your minimum stress increases, uh, by 1.

[GM] 00:00:38
Uh… Carnoc. Uh, you… are nervous.

[GM] 00:00:46
Your stress increases by 1.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:00:50
Yeah. And… When I panicked every close, friendly player must make a fear save.

[GM] 00:00:52
Uh… Alright, everybody make a fear save.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:57
NO!

[GM] 00:01:05
Murderbot succeeds.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:06
Yay!

[Ink] 00:01:08
getting your target's 72.

[GM] 00:01:12
Dex succeeds. ink fails. Zeke fails.

[Ink] 00:01:15
Uh, Pima pants.

[GM] 00:01:18
Alright. Failure on that is just, uh… you just take a stress. Um… Alright, then we've got Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:01:18
Seems also fail as well.

[GM] 00:01:28
Roll to 3. You become jumpy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:01:30
bail.

[GM] 00:01:36
I'm jumpy. Uh, you gain one stress. Everybody else gains too stress.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:41
Oh my god…

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:01:42
Yeah, jumping one.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:42
What? Alright.

[Ink] 00:01:42
Doc, what?

[GM] 00:01:45
I don't know, Zeke… Zeke gets jumpy. Uh… Yeah. Um… Yeah, like… 20 is kind of the highest you'll… Well, no, you can keep… I think you can keep acquiring it, but 20 is, like, the maximum anyways, because, um…

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:47
GM, what's the max stress that you could be at?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:01:49
I'm also… I'm also jumpy from a previous. Failure.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:56
I'm up to 12 now.

[Ink] 00:01:57
Oh my gosh.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:01:57
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 00:01:59
Yeah, I'm at 11.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:02:02
Does that ever go away?

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:04
funny, you're going, like, crazy?

[GM] 00:02:13
when you roll a pan… like, the stress is really just to account for, like, the panic.

[GM] 00:02:18
That you might incur, right? Um, and so if you're rolling a D20, the highest number you would have is 20 ever.

[GM] 00:02:26
So, um, and bad things happen at… At high levels of panic, um… So… Anything above 20 doesn't really change anything.

[GM] 00:02:39
Um, as far as what your panicked eye will do, but… you can't accumulate it higher than 20, because when you go on shore leave to try and convert it into stress and stuff, you don't always get rid of all of it.

[GM] 00:02:49
Alright, um, alright, Dex… Rolled a… 11?

[GM] 00:02:56
Is that right?

[Dex Miro] 00:02:57
Well, it succeeded before I got the extra 2 from Zeke.

[GM] 00:03:01
Yeah, that's fair. This is all simultaneous, so I won't… I won't penalize you for that. And then…

[Ink] 00:03:07
I was the same way. I was 11 before I got my 13 and my 4.

[GM] 00:03:11
Okay, so you guys both succeed. How much stress does Noriko have?

[Dex Miro] 00:03:22
Do you have a character sheet for Hank?

[GM] 00:03:28
And distressed out. He's overwhelmed.

[GM] 00:03:34
Okie dokie. Uh, and with that, that's where we're gonna stop.

[Ink] 00:03:39
Oh, man.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:50
How do you reduce stress and all this, or is this just gonna eventually lead us to just…

[GM] 00:03:50
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:57
losing it, just like everybody else in this…

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:01
Godforsaken hellhole.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:03
is doing.

[GM] 00:04:06
Um, shore leave will reduce your stress.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:09
We have no short leave!

[Dex Miro] 00:04:13
Yeah, we gotta get off this cloud bank first.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:20
What else?

[GM] 00:04:20
Um…

[GM] 00:04:28
Uh, cognitive defragmentation removes one condition.

[Dex Miro] 00:04:36
Basics at that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:04:37
Great. Highly recommended.

[GM] 00:04:41
Yep. It is.
