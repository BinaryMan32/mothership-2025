[GM] 21:27:24
All right, Dex, I'm gonna pop the link in the chat so we can all review what happened last time.

[Dex Miro] 21:27:30
Uh, it's not done. Oh.

[GM] 21:27:31
It's not done. We have to use our memories?

[Dex Miro] 21:27:34
Yeah. It was… Apparently, there was so long between sessions that I forgot to start it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:27:38
What game are we playing?

[GM] 21:27:42
That's okay, Dex. I can remember. Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:27:46
There were a lot of people in places, so it took me a lot longer to do it than… anticipated.

[GM] 21:27:52
Yeah, we did do quite a bit of, uh. And it kind of went fast, so… That totally makes sense. Um…

[GM] 21:27:59
Let's see… So, you guys… are on Prospero's Dream, and you are…

[Ink] 21:28:01
Move through

[GM] 21:28:08
Going around, uh, sort of visiting. Different places, uh, getting a lay of the land.

[GM] 21:28:14
Uh, understanding what… what things were. We spent quite a bit of time.

[GM] 21:28:19
At the Stellar Burn, the club. That has both an upper.

[GM] 21:28:26
Level and a lower level, where you met Indayl. Who… she's the lady with the weird tongue.

[GM] 21:28:31
Um, and you… did quite a bit of carousing in order to relieve stress.

[GM] 21:28:37
Can't remember if we… yeah, that's her. Um, can't remember if we passed, like, a full month or something?

[GM] 21:28:44
I don't remember exactly how much time you guys passed. Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:28:49
Yeah, you said it was weird. It was, like, 48 days or something crazy.

[GM] 21:28:53
Yeah, it was quite a… quite a while past.

[Dex Miro] 21:28:54
Oh, you rolled for it, that's why it was so long.

[GM] 21:28:59
Um… You also got to know about the… Icebox, where you can get a new body, essentially.

[GM] 21:29:07
By downloading your consciousness into a new sleeve. Um, the farm mart is a place where a lot of food is grown, but it has this sort of, like.

[GM] 21:29:18
Uh, large… and sort of, uh… sun… sun type of worship?

[GM] 21:29:25
There's sort of a… not quite a cult, but a religion that's… Built up around, uh, the sun.

[GM] 21:29:32
Uh, you went to Canyon Heavy Market. Uh, to get Quest… From Ingus, um…

[GM] 21:29:41
He asked you guys to find and locate, um… what's her name?

[GM] 21:29:50
Imaging Kane. Pay a 10,000… or 10… yeah, 10,000 credits for… for finding Imogene Kane.

[Murderbot V2] 21:29:54
Oh, that's right, I remember.

[GM] 21:29:58
Ink's just doing the play-by-play with the pictures. Um.

[Dex Miro] 21:30:02
Yeah.

[GM] 21:30:06
So yeah, you got… then, after that, um… I think you guys went to DOPTown.

[GM] 21:30:13
Uh, to find imaging cane. That was the… Um… depleted oxygen.

[GM] 21:30:21
Or, uh, deoxygenated person's town. Um, so you guys took, yeah, you took the…

[GM] 21:30:29
The conveyor… whatever, Lyft… turbo lift down, um, there are a bunch of people starving, or starving of oxygen.

[GM] 21:30:40
Uh, hard to breathe, you guys… walking around, um…

[GM] 21:30:44
Asking about Imogene Kane when you were approached by some… would you presume, uh… They're called…

[GM] 21:30:55
Hung lungs. Um, so the hung lungs, uh, brought you to Imogene Kane, she asked you to.

[GM] 21:31:03
Go and repair, um… the oxygen facility.

[GM] 21:31:08
Because, uh… Zeke was saying that he could rebuild the oxygen facility. I was just throwing that around, casually.

[GM] 21:31:19
So she… she gave you guys… she told you there was a group that had gone with equipment to rebuild it.

[GM] 21:31:25
And told you where to go. So you guys headed off there. You notice, though, some of the people in…

[GM] 21:31:32
Drop Town had these gills on their neck, including her. Um, that's supposed to help them breathe a little bit easier.

[GM] 21:31:41
Uh, you were beset by… Children that heard these weird… deformities that attacked you guys.

[GM] 21:31:49
Um… And you either murdered all of them and or ran them off, I can't remember if there were any that survived.

[GM] 21:31:58
Um… Eventually, you got the…

[GM] 21:32:03
Uh, oxygen facility. Um… wherein…

[GM] 21:32:09
Uh, you entered through a crack, the whole place is sort of dilapidated.

[GM] 21:32:13
Um, there are signs that their previous team had been killed and their bodies sucked dry of blood.

[GM] 21:32:20
Um, but then… in an ambush. Pk, was it you that was gonna be carried off?

[GM] 21:32:27
Or was what Ink's character? Ink, you're on mute.

[Ink] 21:32:33
It was ink. It was ink.

[GM] 21:32:35
Okay, so ink was going to be carried off, but, um… Murderbot ran up and pulled it… pulled the creature off the wall.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:43
Oh, yeah. The best role ever!

[GM] 21:32:44
And then, in a… wild, wild, uh, series of…

[GM] 21:32:52
Uh… hits and critical hits. Uh, you guys… you guys murdered the, uh, the creature.

[Murderbot V2] 21:32:55
Get over here!

[GM] 21:33:00
Uh, and then having the equipment available to you. Uh, Zeke was able to critically repair the machine with MurderBot's help.

[GM] 21:33:10
Um… And uh… yeah. And now, instead of breaking down every…

[GM] 21:33:16
You know, few months. It's actually just full up and running.

[GM] 21:33:21
No problems. Um, upon your return to…

[GM] 21:33:27
Top town, uh, Imogene Kane. Uh, welcomed you guys as heroes.

[GM] 21:33:33
Basically even suggesting that. With the fixed oxygen.

[GM] 21:33:37
Facility that, you know, they have no reason to continue to.

[GM] 21:33:42
Wage the war that they intended on waging. Uh, where her master plan was to go and.

[GM] 21:33:48
Break into the icebox and download all the people from… DOPTown into new sleeves up top.

[GM] 21:33:56
So, um… Now she plans to essentially rebuild a…

[GM] 21:34:04
The future down in DOPTown, uh, and… is willing to help support you in… in…

[GM] 21:34:12
Pretty much almost any ways that you could ask, and so I think the last thing.

[GM] 21:34:18
That we left off with was she was going to reveal how the Sycorax was made.

[GM] 21:34:23
Is that right? Or at least who knew about the Sycorax?

[Dex Miro] 21:34:29
You know, in my notes just ended on a cliffhanger, where Inca asked if she knew anything about cigarettes, and then… dot dot dot.

[GM] 21:34:37
No, I think she said something like, I'll tell you everything I know, and then…

[Dex Miro] 21:34:40
Yeah.

[GM] 21:34:44
Okay. Um.

[GM] 21:34:50
So, you're sitting in a… dilapidated shanty town, uh, I mean, there's…

[GM] 21:34:58
Barely a wall of cardboard between you and the outside. But, you know, just sitting on the outside of the…

[GM] 21:35:05
Of the, um, little hut… is, you know, well-armed guards.

[GM] 21:35:12
Um, even still, she kind of lowers her voice, and she says.

[GM] 21:35:15
All right. So, I've been working with… Uh, UCA.

[GM] 21:35:22
Vocal? I don't know if you've met him or not. Or met them. Is it them? Him?

[Ink] 21:35:29
It didn't look like a…

[GM] 21:35:30
Them. Them. I don't know if you've met them or not.

[GM] 21:35:36
Um, they lead… The Solarian Church.

[GM] 21:35:42
Um… the Solarian Church, uh…

[GM] 21:35:46
Is the source of the drugs. I don't know the actual recipe.

[GM] 21:35:52
But I know that Ukko-Ukka. Is making the drugs.

[GM] 21:35:58
For Yandy. And that Yandy is using…

[GM] 21:36:03
The, um… Teamsters Union to distribute them.

[GM] 21:36:11
Uka Echo has been a stalwart ally to me, though. I think they feel strongly about the oppression that's been had for all these people in DOPTown.

[GM] 21:36:22
And they've been helping, uh, in various different ways, supplying information, supplying.

[GM] 21:36:27
Food and oxygen. Supplying even weapons sometimes.

[GM] 21:36:33
Um, they've always advocated against us. Violently resisting, but… They understand that, like, the struggle of the people down here has been such that…

[GM] 21:36:43
We don't really have much other choice. So, with the oxygen thing being fixed…

[GM] 21:36:51
I suspect that… Ukko-Ukka will turn their attention fully to…

[GM] 21:36:57
The production of the drug. And one of the reasons why.

[GM] 21:37:02
I've run into Uka Aka is because… They come down here for some of it.

[GM] 21:37:07
I don't know what? They usually come down with some heavily armed guards.

[GM] 21:37:13
They wander off into the… The recesses of… DOPTown and beyond.

[GM] 21:37:21
Uh, the area known as the choke. Um…

[GM] 21:37:26
And I'm guessing they're harvesting something out there? But…

[GM] 21:37:33
I don't really want to know. Nor do I think you guys should go looking there.

[GM] 21:37:39
Um, the choke is still dangerous. I've heard stories of… of…

[GM] 21:37:44
Unimaginable things down… down there. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:37:48
So the choke is beyond DOPTown.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:50
Why is it called a choke?

[GM] 21:37:52
Uh, well, part of it was because we didn't have, uh, running life support.

[Murderbot V2] 21:37:58
Hmm…

[GM] 21:37:58
So, you know. Um.

[GM] 21:38:03
But it's also… been choked off from the rest of the… the…

[GM] 21:38:10
The, um, station? Uh, has been left to ruins.

[GM] 21:38:16
And she kind of points off in the distance, she says, if you follow… the sludge in the sewage runoff.

[GM] 21:38:22
You'll… you'll come to a cliff's edge. It's 20 stories down.

[GM] 21:38:26
You'll find an entirely abandoned city. I mean, it's not entirely abandoned, there are things there.

[GM] 21:38:31
There's some insane people that live there. Um, like I said.

[GM] 21:38:37
I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't go there if you paid me to go there.

[GM] 21:38:41
But Uka Uka goes there sometimes.

[Ink] 21:38:47
Who runs the icebox?

[GM] 21:38:50
Um, ultimately, everything's owned by Yandy. Um.

[GM] 21:38:57
The purveyor in that place? Um…

[GM] 21:39:05
Um, is…

[Dex Miro] 21:39:11
I don't think we had told us, actually.

[GM] 21:39:14
Did I? Um… I didn't say it was the Babushka, did I?

[Murderbot V2] 21:39:25
Babushka!

[GM] 21:39:26
The Babushka?

[Dex Miro] 21:39:28
I don't have it in my notes from last time.

[Ink] 21:39:43
And Yandy is the highest person in the station?

[GM] 21:39:47
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:50
Like, Golyanovo Il Bratva, or whatever it was, yeah.

[GM] 21:39:54
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:39:56
Golyanovo Il Bratva. Oh, I put Dandy, that's right.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:03
Dandy?

[Ink] 21:40:04
That's what I wrote it last time. I was like, how can I find Yandy? Because I wrote main guy, Dandy.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:14
So we can't get rid of Uku Oka.

[GM] 21:40:20
I assume you're not asking. Uh, imaging cane that.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:20
Right? Because… I'm… No, no, no, no, I'm talking to the crew.

[GM] 21:40:25
Okay. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:27
Telepathically.

[Ink] 21:40:28
But, like… yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:40:32
Until we get the mods for that?

[Murderbot V2] 21:40:36
Yeah, we spliced ourselves. Also, that we can hear…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:40:38
Sweet.

[Ink] 21:40:41
All right, so, um, so her plan was to upload herself into… or some of the people into the, um, the sleeves and the icebox.

[Ink] 21:40:50
Can I inquire more about that… that plan? I know she doesn't plan on conducting it anymore, but I was just curious about what that would have entailed.

[GM] 21:40:58
Um, there are essentially tunnels leading from DOPTown all the way up to the… what they call the surface. Like…

[GM] 21:41:06
Up to the ring part of the station. Uh, and so their plan was to find a set of tunnels that would lead them.

[GM] 21:41:14
Near the sleeve, or near the icebox. Blow a hole in the wall.

[GM] 21:41:19
Barricade themselves in and begin the process of downloading. Themselves.

[Ink] 21:41:23
Gotcha. And when you download yourself into a sleeve, are you… are you split into two people at that point? Like, in your original body, or you leave your… your original sleep behind.

[GM] 21:41:35
Um, you… can, um… Uh, I don't know if there's enough.

[GM] 21:41:43
Backup space for everyone in DOPTown to essentially. Have a backup for their… you know, essentially download, like.

[GM] 21:41:52
There's, like, a direct transfer, like, a copy from disk to disk, or you could copy it to the hard drive, and then from the hard drive to the disk, right?

[GM] 21:41:58
So, there's not necessarily enough space.

[Ink] 21:41:58
Kind of cloning myself, right, so that I could send, uh, myself and, or, you know, my clone into battle and… I'd be safe.

[GM] 21:42:06
Yeah. She tells you, though, there's some stories about how having two of you around can kind of fuck one's psyche up a little bit.

[Ink] 21:42:14
Okay, so there's still some kind of connection. Yeah, so we'll just have, uh…

[GM] 21:42:16
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:42:20
Zeke's character do it. His sister, like, he's really strong.

[Dex Miro] 21:42:24
He's all good at the crazy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:42:24
Sure. I am at the praising.

[GM] 21:42:27
He already tried to do this once, you know? Yeah, I went over swimmingly. That's why he's on this mission, you know.

[Ink] 21:42:29
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:42:30
Worked really well.

[GM] 21:42:35
Because it went so well the first time.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:42:35
I got promoted.

[Ink] 21:42:42
In the… eliminate the head, if possible, so from what the information she's given us.

[Ink] 21:42:48
Would the main guy still be Yandy that we want to eliminate, or Ukko-Ukka? Because Ukko-Ukka's making the drug.

[Murderbot V2] 21:42:55
Yeah, it sounds like he's the… is, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:00
You know, he's the one to… Hmm.

[GM] 21:43:03
Uh, are you asking her that?

[Ink] 21:43:05
No, I'm asking GM that.

[GM] 21:43:09
Um… Well… well, all I can really tell you is that…

[GM] 21:43:14
Ukko-Ukka's making… making the drug. Yandy's the one that's sort of organizing everything, keeping people in line.

[GM] 21:43:20
And profiting the most from all of it. And then the Teamsters are the ones that are distributing it, so… Yandy works, uh, because of the relationship between the Bratva and, um…

[GM] 21:43:30
The Tempest Company, which is the mercenary branch. So the mercenaries kind of keep.

[GM] 21:43:35
Everything in order and slash keep the drug production safe. Um, Yandy kind of is sitting above all three organizations.

[GM] 21:43:45
Uh, but keeps them all in line.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:48
So, what… do we already know, like, what does the drug do? Is that a question?

[Ink] 21:43:51
No, that's a good point.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:43:51
That I should know the answer to.

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:53
You should know that answer. Like, heroin.

[GM] 21:43:56
Um… Sycorax. Uh, it is…

[GM] 21:44:02
Extremely useful, uh, in… helping with body modification.

[GM] 21:44:08
So, when taken and then, uh, going underneath. Into surgery for body modification, it increases the chances of success significantly.

[GM] 21:44:21
Uh, this body modification's been outlawed within… The rest of the, you know, something that elite happens illegally, because oftentimes it doesn't take and can cause, um…

[GM] 21:44:32
Severe mutations and stress. Um, so rather than…

[GM] 21:44:38
Having the rest of the world. Or worlds, universe, deal with all that. Uh, the company is more or less outlawed it.

[GM] 21:44:46
That being said, um… you know, having access to this type of drug.

[GM] 21:44:51
Would mean that, you know, body modification would be. Much more, um…

[GM] 21:44:57
Accessible. And you've already seen on… while being on Prosperous Dream, there are many, many people with body modifications.

[GM] 21:45:07
Whereas, when you're on your company ship, like, no one has them.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:17
Why is Ukko-Ukka making the drug? I mean, does he want to… Have it sent outside of Prospero's dream, or is it just for…

[Dex Miro] 21:45:25
Local use.

[GM] 21:45:28
Um, imaging doesn't know. Why exactly? But… speculates that Yandy's got something on everybody.

[Dex Miro] 21:45:37
Yeah.

[GM] 21:45:39
Uh, she got something on Ingus, she's got something on Ukko-Ukka, she's got something on… the leader of Tempest. There are a few people that are loyal to Yandy, uh…

[GM] 21:45:50
Even without it, um, Brunhilde is definitely one of those people.

[GM] 21:45:56
Um… But… yeah. She's just got something on everybody.

[GM] 21:46:01
Everyone's beholden to her in some way. Yep.

[Ink] 21:46:04
Rude Hilda's the judge. Like, there's, like, a let… like, a legal system?

[GM] 21:46:11
Kind of, uh, it's not… it's, you know, by legal, you mean, like.

[GM] 21:46:16
You can essentially go into a Gladiator Arena to fight for your survival, and if you come out.

[Ink] 21:46:22
So she's the one that goes like this? Okay. Um…

[GM] 21:46:24
Yes, that's exactly right.

[Ink] 21:46:29
Gotcha. So, Imogene is good with Uka Aka.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:30
Cool. Trial by combat.

[Ink] 21:46:36
And would have been attacking who? If we hadn't repaired the, uh…

[Ink] 21:46:43
Air system.

[GM] 21:46:45
Well, Imogene's resistance is primarily against Yandy's rule of the. Surface, the… the ring area.

[GM] 21:46:53
So, in trying to download all the people into sleeves. Like, that was just an assault on Yandy, you know.

[GM] 21:47:02
If you… if you connect everything together.

[Ink] 21:47:05
Okay, so she would have been trying to attack Yandy, overthrow Andy, so they could get resources to repair their, uh… their air system.

[GM] 21:47:12
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:47:13
Um, what's… what's, uh, her relationship with Ingus, the data broker?

[GM] 21:47:19
Uh… he's essentially the intelligence arm of the Tempest company.

[GM] 21:47:25
And the bratva? Um, he's an information broker, and I don't know what…

[GM] 21:47:32
She's got on him? That must be something really good. Uh, because he can pretty much find anything on anybody.

[Ink] 21:47:43
Ingus must have something on… on her. Oh, yeah, he must have something on there. But, um, but, uh, Uka… I'm sorry, not, uh…

[GM] 21:47:44
No, no, Yandy must have something on. Him.

[GM] 21:47:53
Ingus.

[Ink] 21:47:53
Who retire… with slavery. Ingus is… I want to know what, um… sorry, what's the lady we're talking to whose name? Imogene, what's Imogene's relationship with Ingus?

[GM] 21:48:04
Nothing really. Uh… Can't say I've ever met him.

[Ink] 21:48:07
So… Gotcha, so Ingus sent us down here to locate you.

[Ink] 21:48:12
I get what I want to call it. Why not, yeah.

[GM] 21:48:13
Can you tell her that?

[GM] 21:48:18
Um, well, that means I've made a name for myself enough that, uh, Yandy's probably trying to figure out where I am and how to kill me.

[Ink] 21:48:26
Okay. Well, there's 10,000 credits in there!

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:27
Don't worry, we're not going to.

[GM] 21:48:33
She was like, I… I wouldn't blame you if you did, but you can tell them.

[GM] 21:48:38
That you guys fixed this thing, and we're done. Um, with that, she, like.

[GM] 21:48:46
Takes off, uh, she's, like, wearing gloves. Just pulls off a glove, and she pulls out a knife.

[GM] 21:48:51
And she… takes it and cuts off her finger, her trigger finger.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:57
What! What!

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:57
Oh, my.

[GM] 21:48:59
Hands it to you, and then… stems the bleeding.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:04
Thanks, lady.

[GM] 21:49:05
Uh… She goes a bit pale, and she's like…

[GM] 21:49:12
They'll know. I'm done fighting.

[Ink] 21:49:15
Okay, um, I'll take the finger and hand it to Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:19
Whoa! Uh, okay?

[Ink] 21:49:20
Where'd my whole life. All right, well, uh…

[Ink] 21:49:26
I guess, uh, thank you so much for all your information.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:29
Thanks for your finger!

[Ink] 21:49:31
Um, we'll let them know that you're done, and hopefully… keep away from you.

[GM] 21:49:36
She smiles, like, kind of in a, like, a… not really lucid sense, and says, you know.

[GM] 21:49:42
Make sure you still pay whatever they promised you, even though they don't need to kill me anymore.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:50
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:49:51
All right. I think I'm good to go, guys.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:52
Oh. My. God.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:49:55
Yeah, let's go.

[Murderbot V2] 21:49:58
What just happened?

[Ink] 21:49:59
All right, we have two places we can go. We're already down here, so anybody want to go to the choke?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:50:08
Um… I'll… I'll watch.

[Ink] 21:50:14
Maybe you'll watch as I, uh, rappel down 20 stories into the choke.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:14
He'll watch.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:50:19
We'll supervise. Stand guard, you never know.

[Ink] 21:50:24
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go try to get a sleeve. For 10,000 credits here, with this.

[Murderbot V2] 21:50:29
Yeah, you're gonna try to get a sleeve, is that what you just said?

[Ink] 21:50:32
I'm gonna say that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:50:33
And that's what I would do with that amount of money in real life, right? Like, yep.

[Ink] 21:50:38
Alright. I'm ready to go up and go back to Ingus.

[GM] 21:50:40
Alright. I thought you were going down to the choke.

[Ink] 21:50:47
I don't know. Yeah.

[GM] 21:50:48
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:50:52
We can always come back down here, eh? Let's go, let's go. We only… well, we have oxygen out here, we're not worried about our oxygen running out anymore, are we?

[GM] 21:50:54
Yeah.

[GM] 21:51:03
Yeah. Um… As you leave the house and start walking through, uh…

[GM] 21:51:08
The row houses of… StopTown. Someone… someone says, It's Zeke!

[GM] 21:51:15
Zeke! Zeke! Zeke! Zeke! Zeke! Crowds break out chanting, and people come up, and they're, like, pawing at you, like, just wanting to just…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:51:15
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

[GM] 21:51:26
Touch you, knowing that you… you know, you're the savior of DOPTown.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:51:29
I feel like I should have a donations jar out. Tips?

[Ink] 21:51:33
I think all you get is fingers, dude.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:51:35
That's probably right. I don't need more fingers.

[GM] 21:51:38
Um, they… they do this weird ritual. Uh, which is that they, they, like.

[Dex Miro] 21:51:41
Because we're virtual.

[GM] 21:51:45
Breathe in a lot, and then they blow it at you. They go…

[Ink] 21:51:50
That makes sense.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:51:50
Yeah, that's the air I gave you, that's right. Thank you.

[GM] 21:51:52
Yeah, it's symbolic, it's like the most precious thing they have, and they blow it at you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:51:56
No. Yeah. Probably COVID, probably have COVID, yeah.

[GM] 21:51:57
It smells terrible. Like, these people don't…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:52:02
After COVID, but…

[GM] 21:52:04
They also don't have toothpaste, because they're very poor. So… Interesting.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:52:08
Fantastic.

[GM] 21:52:12
Um, you get to the turbo lift, um… the guards seem rather nonchalant, uh, as you approach.

[GM] 21:52:22
Um, you hand out your… or… Hold up your, uh…

[GM] 21:52:27
Passes, what are they called?

[Murderbot V2] 21:52:37
Acids are passive.

[GM] 21:52:37
Um… Is it… is it linked to your cred stick? Your O2 cred stick?

[Dex Miro] 21:52:37
Big sticks.

[GM] 21:52:43
I thought there was, like, some sort of… Like, it's not a wristband.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:47
Both were dot town, yeah.

[GM] 21:52:49
Yeah, I thought they gave you some sort of ID chip or something that they told you not to lose.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:52:53
Abby, what are you doing, sweetie?

[GM] 21:52:57
Just got our ID chip. Um, no worries, uh, whatever. You hand them your identification, um…

[GM] 21:53:06
And then, like… There's still a few people, stragglers, that have been following you through the houses and the…

[GM] 21:53:13
The… one of them yells at the guards, they're like, did you know this is Zeke?

[GM] 21:53:19
He saved us all! He saved all of us! The…

[GM] 21:53:27
The kernel… Colonel Antonio. Approaches, he's like.

[GM] 21:53:33
Sure, but don't… don't go get in your heads that you're worth any more that… because he saved you and put oxygen in your lungs.

[GM] 21:53:39
You guys still live down here. You're not getting out.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:53:43
Zeke will fix that, too.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:46
Wow.

[GM] 21:53:49
Zeke! Zeke! Zeke! Zeke! Cheers go up. Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:52
Wow.

[GM] 21:53:56
The Colonel gives Zeke kind of a glare. It's like, don't go riling them up and give him hope.

[GM] 21:54:01
There's no hope down here. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:54:05
Never mind, Colonel.

[GM] 21:54:08
It just says, you cannot get back into the dream without a pass.

[GM] 21:54:11
So, you guys have passes, whatever they look like. Um… It takes 30 minutes, uh, for the elevator to arrive.

[GM] 21:54:23
A few people get off, all of them pretty heavily armed.

[GM] 21:54:29
You get on, door closes behind you, and you start the ride up.

[GM] 21:54:34
Um, no… no DOPTownians, uh… you know, people that obviously cannot afford or do not have a pass get on with you.

[GM] 21:54:43
Um… Yeah. Sit there, there's some… Weird elevator music playing.

[GM] 21:54:50
Yeah, it's like… it's all electronic and stuff, though, it's like, beep, beep, beep!

[GM] 21:55:01
Um…

[GM] 21:55:07
Um, alright. You arrive back up at the top. To put you at…

[GM] 21:55:13
Let's see… um… Where's the elevator?

[GM] 21:55:21
9, 7? No, that's the court. Um…

[GM] 21:55:27
Okay. It must be… close to maybe…

[GM] 21:55:32
9 is the… where you go down. 2. That's DOPTown is on the map.

[GM] 21:55:38
So, maybe you're close to, like, the… Uh, dry dock slash… Yeah.

[GM] 21:55:47
Um, the door is open, and… Once again, a bunch of heavily armed people standing there.

[GM] 21:55:54
Um… It looks like they're ready to get on and go down to DOPTown.

[GM] 21:56:00
Uh, one of them holds up a sort of a wristwatch and a, you know, sort of a digital.

[GM] 21:56:06
Display appears above it. Uh, and it's… it's Zeke's face.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:10
Oh.

[GM] 21:56:12
Um… I think that Zeke over there.

[GM] 21:56:17
Um, and… There are…

[GM] 21:56:25
13 heavily armed men that lair… level their guns at you.

[GM] 21:56:30
And they're like… You're coming with us, Yandy wants to talk.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:37
Who's the Andy?

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:40
Oh my god.

[GM] 21:56:41
You're about to find out.

[Ink] 21:56:42
You'll find it.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:43
There's a lot of Zeke question, or a Zeke question? Okay, because both of you should know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:47
Z question.

[GM] 21:56:52
Uh… further, uh… to note is that two of these heavily armed people are in exo suits.

[GM] 21:57:01
Um, which… makes them quite intimidating.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:04
I'm not gonna mess with them. I got supporters.

[GM] 21:57:10
He's just like, I'm famous, you can't do anything to me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:12
Yeah.

[GM] 21:57:16
Um… They… if you… if you're not going to resist, uh, just come.

[GM] 21:57:24
Sort of, compliantly, they don't rough you up or anything, they just walk with you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:57:28
Yeah, no, I'll go with them, I'll go with them. Oh, well, I don't know Murderbot's gonna come easily.

[GM] 21:57:30
Okay. Well, they want everybody, not just you.

[Ink] 21:57:37
He'll do whatever. Do whatever Carnoc says to do. Carnoc's not here.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:38
Oh, I'll go! I'll go.

[GM] 21:57:44
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:44
Where is Carnoc? Carnoc!

[Dex Miro] 21:57:46
Do we have to roll to see what Carnoc says?

[GM] 21:57:49
No, we'll assume he's… he's wanting to…

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:52
Oh, wait, wait, say this again, who wants… who… who wants to see us?

[GM] 21:57:56
Yandy wants to see you.

[Murderbot V2] 21:57:56
Yeah, Andy wants to see… oh, shit. The head honcho?

[Dex Miro] 21:57:58
Yeah, the guy we probably don't want to see. Yeah.

[GM] 21:58:02
Yeah. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:04
Wonderful.

[Ink] 21:58:05
Now, if we blow up Murderbot. We can just get a new one, right?

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:10
Easy! Easy! Whoa! Oh, holy cow, man!

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:15
They're on sale, you could get two.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:17
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening right now?

[Ink] 21:58:20
Um, like, murder by… do you have, like, one of those fusion reactors, like Terminator 3?

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:24
I'm not gonna tell you! Unless you order me to tell you!

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:28
To start pressing them in various places. One of them's probably it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:31
Self-destruct.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:33
Damn! Wow, this is no love whatsoever here!

[Ink] 21:58:34
And Zeke goes around going. We just… we'll just upload you.

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:40
I saved your life, motherfucker!

[Ink] 21:58:42
Get you a new one! And you'll… and you will remember it exactly that way.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:58:46
Actually, we could probably just cut out the part of his memory where he blows up, so it just looks continuous to him, and he's just like, wait, what happened? I'm here, but there's, like, was an explosion somewhere?

[Dex Miro] 21:58:48
Maybe.

[Ink] 21:58:56
We'll just rewrite it, where he, like. Kill Yandy and takes out exoskeleton, dude?

[Murderbot V2] 21:58:58
Alright, I'm processing this through my… my artificial intelligence module, and I… all it is, all it's outputting is.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:07
Kill… kill ink.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:13
Yeah, you press the button.

[GM] 21:59:17
Um, they… have, like, little… those little, um… airport go-kart thingies that…

[GM] 21:59:24
Go to the airport, and they put you on, like, one of those things.

[GM] 21:59:29
Um, so you're driving through, uh, most of the station. They actually take you back to somewhere familiar, uh, they take you to Canyon Heavy.

[GM] 21:59:38
Market. Um, and they…

[GM] 21:59:43
You go into the main room, the 0G, where all the… Um, what are the, like, digital cowboys? What are they called?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:59:54
At Erlang

[GM] 21:59:56
Council cowboys. Um, so all the Council Cowboys are floating around, they pay you no mind when you come in, even though there's heavily armed men with you.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:59
Also, cowboys, what does that mean?

[GM] 22:00:06
Um, there's a door at the back of the… on the other side of the room.

[GM] 22:00:12
Which is kind of far away, it's a very large space.

[GM] 22:00:15
Uh, the door opens, and inside is… A humming nest of servers and terminals.

[GM] 22:00:22
Uh, with the atmosphere of a church. It's, like, extremely clean, well-lit.

[GM] 22:00:29
Um, there's sort of a… you know, all these… all these terminals and servers are running heavily. It's…

[GM] 22:00:36
Being cooled, um… So it's not overly hot in here, um…

[GM] 22:00:43
But there is this sort of, like, almost… reverence, uh, when you enter this space. It's like, this is clearly, uh, the…

[GM] 22:00:53
Brain of this station. Um… No, you're in Canyon-heavy data cache.

[Ink] 22:00:56
We're in Silurian Church, then, or…

[GM] 22:01:04
Um… there are…

[GM] 22:01:09
They look like, uh… Council Cowboys?

[GM] 22:01:13
But they have a much more serious attitude to what they're doing. A lot of them are, like, coding and stuff.

[GM] 22:01:22
Yeah, it almost, you know, it's sort of… much more somber than the sort of other room where there's, like, people, like, gathering on things, kicking off, and just, like.

[GM] 22:01:32
Tooting and hollering and stuff. Um, you go through another door, there's, like, 3 doors in this… off of this room.

[GM] 22:01:40
Uh, you go to another door, or another… office… or space, um, and this is…

[GM] 22:01:47
Ingus's office. It is also 0G. Um…

[GM] 22:01:54
It's a cramped and dingy office, crammed with blinking terminals, mechanical keyboards, and discarded takeout boxes.

[GM] 22:02:02
Um, floating through the air. Uh, the armed guard that's been escorting you doesn't go in, obviously, it's too cramped for that.

[GM] 22:02:11
Uh, but they usher all of you in. There's not really a place to sit, but zero G, so it's not that big a deal.

[GM] 22:02:18
Um.

[GM] 22:02:23
Inside… You see Ingus and… woman, who you have not met.

[GM] 22:02:31
I will show you her picture.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:37
Oh, fuck! Wait, we've seen this one.

[GM] 22:02:38
No, not the one with the tongue. Yeah, you've seen this one. I'm revealing her now, she's in the top.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:42
Okay.

[GM] 22:02:45
Middle next to Brunhilde.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:48
The fuck?

[GM] 22:02:53
Um… Ingus immediately identifies you guys, says, yep, that's them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:01
The fuck asks you, motherfucker!

[Dex Miro] 22:03:03
But… so the other one's just sitting in there? The… the new one, what was… do we not remember him yet?

[GM] 22:03:05
What do you mean?

[GM] 22:03:11
Yeah, I mean, you could presume it's Yandy. Yeah. Because the guys did say they were coming to take you to see Andy, and then…

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:13
Oh, that's Andy.

[Dex Miro] 22:03:14
That is Andy, okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:03:19
This is true.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:21
Self-destruct initiated, 5… 4, 3, run, motherfuckers!

[GM] 22:03:21
This is…

[Dex Miro] 22:03:27
Uh, you're supposed to be pretending to not be a robot?

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:31
2… 1… BOOM!

[GM] 22:03:34
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:03:35
Karnak keeps elbowing right above it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:03:37
Okay, shutting down, self-destruct.

[GM] 22:03:41
Uh, she… she does give a slight… smirk as, uh, Ingus identifies you guys. So…

[GM] 22:03:48
Heroes of DOPTown, I hear. That's… that's impressive.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:52
That's us.

[GM] 22:03:55
You're the one, Zeke? Good.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:03:57
That would be me, yes. Along with my friends here, but I'll take the credit.

[GM] 22:04:02
Good work. Uh, Ingus, pay them for… for finding Imogene.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:03
Thank you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:04:08
Did you want this finger?

[GM] 22:04:09
And he said, you… Oh, she's actually a little…

[GM] 22:04:13
Surprised by that. Now, that's a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:15
Murderbot produces it from his mouth.

[GM] 22:04:20
Uh, you're like… send it… send it over to her, like, spit it towards her so it floats through the air.

[Murderbot V2] 22:04:24
Yeah, I was like, bleh.

[GM] 22:04:28
She says, Ingus, check the… check the… genes on that, would you? Make sure it's hers.

[GM] 22:04:35
Um… he's like, well, okay, he's in the midst of, like, he has this, like.

[GM] 22:04:40
Arm pad. He's punching in some numbers and stuff on there.

[GM] 22:04:44
Um, and then as soon as she says that, he abandons that, grabs the finger, and then… Goes over to a terminal nearby and, like.

[GM] 22:04:50
Basically starts fiddling with that. And, uh, Yandy turns back to you and says.

[GM] 22:04:57
Well, as soon as he's done verifying that. Um, well…

[GM] 22:05:02
Frankly, I owe quite a bit more than $10,000. Let's see…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:08
Sure, yeah, we'll take more.

[GM] 22:05:10
How much more do I owe you?

[GM] 22:05:18
Ah… Um…

[GM] 22:05:27
Shoot.

[GM] 22:05:34
How about half a million?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:37
That's a lot more!

[GM] 22:05:41
Ingus? Give them another half mil.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:47
What is happening?

[Ink] 22:05:51
I'm worried about… you can… you can turn on silage truck sequence now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:05:53
Yeah, that's okay.

[Ink] 22:05:56
Everything's good. I think, uh, we can retire from the company.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:01
Yep.

[GM] 22:06:04
Uh, before you go doing that. I have a job for you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:08
Uh-oh.

[GM] 22:06:09
Not that you said that you were actually with the company in front of her, but… Um.

[GM] 22:06:15
You may recall this face, and she… there's a little display in front of you, and she… kind of, uh, pulls up a picture, a sort of 3D holographic picture of.

[GM] 22:06:26
Um… Oh, what's the… what the fuck is his name? The guy that came with you on the ship.

[Dex Miro] 22:06:32
Phoenix. Phoenix?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:32
Oh, yeah.

[GM] 22:06:33
What's that? Phoenix, yeah. Phoenix done right.

[GM] 22:06:39
I had a little chat with Phoenix. He pretty much gave you a right away.

[GM] 22:06:45
He told me about… being an employee of the company.

[GM] 22:06:48
That you were sent here. Find out about Sycorax, and… potentially take me out.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:49
Gotta fucking kill that guy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:56
Oh, fuck!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:06:57
Oh, dude, do you think, like, we give a shit about.

[Ink] 22:06:58
That phoenix, he's such a kidder.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:04
I was gonna say, like, do you think we care about the company?

[GM] 22:07:08
Well, I'm hoping you don't, because I have a job for you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:11
They're… they're garbage.

[GM] 22:07:13
How much, like, garbage are they?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:16
Well, they scramble…

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:17
Self-destruct starting in…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:23
They take advantage of their employee, my brain gets fragged, and they're like, oh, that'll cost you $10,000, even though it was on company time.

[GM] 22:07:33
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, what… what… how do you all deal with your trash?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:33
They're just a bunch of scam artists. They enslave people.

[GM] 22:07:42
You're garbage.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:44
Phew, I don't know.

[Ink] 22:07:45
I like to incinerate it, that's my favorite thing.

[GM] 22:07:48
Uh, well, I'd be willing to… Perhaps, uh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:07:49
Tell you half a million dollars will change how we deal with our garbage.

[GM] 22:08:01
Offer you a bit more to incinerate. This garbage.

[GM] 22:08:10
First… Tell me the, uh, the mission you're on.

[Ink] 22:08:18
Well, we barely know who you are. Um… I think she… she repeated it back to us already, didn't she? Pretty much, uh…

[Ink] 22:08:26
Understand what Sycorax was. And identify who is producing it, maybe take them out.

[GM] 22:08:34
Yeah. Hmm. Okay. What do you think?

[GM] 22:08:39
The company you sent to after me.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:42
Assume you're cutting into their profits.

[GM] 22:08:48
But Sycorax is outlawed. You know, I'm just serving a market that, you know.

[GM] 22:08:54
Has no space in their world.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:59
I mean, you're obviously threatening. Them somehow. They only care about money.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:06
So… You tell us, how is this drug threatening their bottom line?

[GM] 22:09:16
I don't think they think it's a threat. I think they want yet another place to make profit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:23
That makes sense, too.

[GM] 22:09:25
I think they want to take over this market. Cut everybody else out, and own everything, just as they always do.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:09:34
It's like they tried to own us.

[GM] 22:09:36
That's right. You all, and she kind of waves her hand.

[GM] 22:09:42
Companies seeing all of you. Do all are… just… another piece of machinery.

[GM] 22:09:50
To them. Easily replaced. Hell, if one of you was an android, I'm sure they probably have a dozen more like you.

[GM] 22:09:59
Just easily replaced.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:00
Right, are we talking in the game or in real life?

[Ink] 22:10:04
Totally replace the all of you guys.

[GM] 22:10:08
Ink's irreplaceable, though. He's the only one. Um…

[GM] 22:10:15
So… I think… they're just using you to extend… you know, they're…

[GM] 22:10:24
Their market share… open up new markets. I'm sure if they found out the secret of Sycorax, they probably even.

[GM] 22:10:31
Begin to allow modification. Legally speaking.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:10:39
Maybe. I mean, I…

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:39
What's your proposal?

[GM] 22:10:42
My proposal is this. I, too, think…

[GM] 22:10:47
Burning it trash. Is appropriate.

[GM] 22:10:53
I can give you some suitable evidence for you to return.

[GM] 22:10:57
To the company with. And now I'm not talking about the whole thing.

[GM] 22:11:02
But there is a particular syndicate. That you are affiliated with.

[GM] 22:11:07
There were, like, nothing more than to send a message to.

[GM] 22:11:11
You'll carry? A briefcase. Small thing.

[GM] 22:11:16
And… go on the ship. And just leave the briefcase behind.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:16
Sorry.

[GM] 22:11:24
Then return here for payment.

[GM] 22:11:30
The one you guys came from. Just that ship.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:11:30
Would ship? Just the one we came from? Just that ship?

[GM] 22:11:36
Now. The slight complication is that I also would like you to try.

[GM] 22:11:43
And attract some attention. To, uh… what you… what you've returned with.

[GM] 22:11:51
Meaning that I will give you a sufficiently attractive thing such that.

[GM] 22:11:55
You might get a CEO. Or at least some higher-up in the company.

[GM] 22:12:01
To come and visit with you. Sell them on the notion that.

[GM] 22:12:07
You've found something quite remarkable. Once they're there, then you leave before they leave.

[Ink] 22:12:19
Okay, so she's… she's gonna give us two things. A suitcase to leave… a briefcase to leave there, and then something that will attract the attention of a CEO, and will come in and say.

[Ink] 22:12:29
We got this awesome thing, but we're only gonna talk to somebody higher up.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:34
I think that's what we're saying, that that's what we have in the suitcase. We've got this awesome thing in the suitcase, right?

[GM] 22:12:35
Yeah.

[GM] 22:12:39
Yeah, that could be in this case, too.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:44
She just wants to blow up, like, the board of directors of this company.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:48
That's, like, basically, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:49
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:53
So, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:56
And in return for doing this deed?

[GM] 22:13:01
2 million credits. Hmm. Well, that's a hard bargain.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:03
2 million credits each?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:08
Well, I mean, we are… Risking a lot here.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:13:09
Here's a question.

[GM] 22:13:13
How about a million each?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:15
You… you want us to… you want us to trust you.

[Ink] 22:13:19
A million is pretty good, right? That's 5 million? So you just… 250% of what she offered before?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:19
With whatever this package is.

[GM] 22:13:26
A million each.

[Ink] 22:13:31
Um, as far as, uh. Traceability back to us with the suitcase, anything like that? Any suggestions on how we cover our tracks?

[GM] 22:13:39
Just don't get caught. Well…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:41
What if we fail? We just don't get paid?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:45
Is that what you're saying? Or do we get paid ahead of time?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:51
To do this.

[GM] 22:13:51
Um… How about this?

[GM] 22:13:55
Is part of your upfront… payment.

[GM] 22:14:00
In the… in my faith in you, and to increase the odds of your success.

[GM] 22:14:04
I will order the babushka. To do some body modification for you.

[GM] 22:14:12
Um, that being said. It will come out of your 1 million.

[GM] 22:14:17
So feel free to get whatever you want, but just know it's gonna come out of your 1 million.

[GM] 22:14:23
Um, and also know that you'll have to take Sycorax. Well, you don't have to, but I highly recommend it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:33
How about a gesture of good faith? You give us these mods so that we CAN actually execute this plan better.

[Ink] 22:14:39
That's what… that's what she's doing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:40
No, no, no, but she's taking it out of her million pay.

[GM] 22:14:40
Yeah, I'm…

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:45
No, no, no, no, no. Payment's a payment.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:14:47
He's paying us a million dollars.

[Ink] 22:14:49
I think credit, sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:51
Payment's a payment. Modifications to help you. Finish this mission. That's something different. That's something to help you execute this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:59
And get it done.

[Ink] 22:15:02
Plus, unless you can't… you can't get modifications. Can you?

[GM] 22:15:02
So you want, what, $250,000 up front? You can spend it on the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:05
No, we want any modifications, and then the million in full afterwards, without taking anything out of it for the modifications.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:14
Well, I don't… okay, this is coming from me. I don't know how much modifications cost. So, it could be, like, $5,000 for the best modification, and I'm sitting here, like… like, squabbling over… nothing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:28
I don't know, I don't know what modification… what's like a… We can't afford modifications, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:15:31
Maybe, yeah, maybe we should, uh…

[Ink] 22:15:36
You know, you can't get them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:37
Well, she doesn't know that shh! Be quiet!

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:43
She don't know! That's why I'm trying to get the full million!

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:49
What if I don't get modifications?

[GM] 22:15:51
That's fine. I will… up to 100,000… in modifications.

[GM] 22:15:57
Up front.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:58
GM, can I get a sense of how much a modification, like, what's, like… what's, like, the top modification we'll run?

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:05
Normally, for a person or something like that.

[GM] 22:16:07
Um, it's definitely should be, like, modifications, given the, the, um… amount of them that are available on the station, like, everyone walking around with, like, some form of mod, it seems like it's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:19
Yeah.

[GM] 22:16:20
You know, there are probably some really cheap ones. There's also probably some really expensive ones.

[GM] 22:16:25
So, you know, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:27
Like, hundreds of thousands of dollars? Or tens of thousands of dollars, like the skew.

[GM] 22:16:32
Without having gone and observed prices, it's hard to know, but you imagine, given that everyone has some.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:35
Okay, gotcha.

[GM] 22:16:40
That there are some really cheap ones. Uh, probably. And then there are probably some much more expensive ones.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:46
Okay.

[GM] 22:16:49
Um, but she says, essentially. Up to $100,000.

[GM] 22:16:54
Or hundreds of thousand credits. In modifications up front, and then a million when you complete.

[Murderbot V2] 22:16:58
Okay. Gotcha.

[GM] 22:17:03
Um, but… Ingus will have another job for you when you get back.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:04
But… What the fuck is this shit? I'm just adding to the con- now you just up the… up…

[GM] 22:17:13
No, no, no, no, here's the thing. It's… the… the… it will be a separate payment, and you can opt in or opt-out.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:15
Off the feet of 1.5, bitch! Okay, no, I'm just kidding.

[GM] 22:17:22
No, there's no… mandatory service or anything.

[GM] 22:17:25
I don't run my businesses like that. But I think you'll want to hear what Ingus has to offer.

[Ink] 22:17:32
Well, we'll be looking for new employment.

[GM] 22:17:34
He, uh… He's over working on the finger, and he kind of laughs himself. He's like, okay!

[GM] 22:17:41
If you think they are up for it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:43
Oh, boy. What's the… what's… okay, say that we do… we do our best, we try to… we lure them in.

[Murderbot V2] 22:17:51
Something goes wrong, either whatever you gave us doesn't do its job, or… We get sniffed out, or whatever, we do everything right, but it just doesn't happen. What then?

[Ink] 22:18:05
I probably don't make it back here.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:06
Is it just that we don't get paid, or is… Or are you coming after us?

[GM] 22:18:11
Um. If you… if you fuck this up.

[GM] 22:18:16
That ship of yours? That you're going home in? I can tell you right now, the company is…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:17
Oh, boy.

[GM] 22:18:22
You won't escape the company in that thing.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:24
Uh, so that, like, it's, it's our lives are forfeit anyway for attempting it, that's what you're saying?

[GM] 22:18:30
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:31
Gotcha.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:38
Well then, are we gonna listen to, um… what's-his-face's proposal to right now, or…

[Dex Miro] 22:18:46
I don't think he's gonna tell us right now. No, he's not gonna tell us no. He's gonna tell us after we do the other job.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:46
Is it after we get the… Okay, he's gonna tell us right now? Alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:51
Oh, he's not gonna tell us right now? Oh, we had to finish the job first, and then he's gonna tell us, okay, gotcha.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:18:51
And so we're done.

[GM] 22:18:55
Yeah. Yeah, Ingus is like, you gotta survive this one first, guys.

[Dex Miro] 22:18:56
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:01
Damn!

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:07
Okay…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:09
Right? Can we, like, step off to the side and talk amongst ourselves for a second?

[Dex Miro] 22:19:15
Of course, there's… this place is probably full of surveillance devices anyway, so there's really no point.

[Ink] 22:19:23
Let's use our secret gesture language that we developed beforehand.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:26
Do we have a code of silence?

[GM] 22:19:28
If you want to take a dig to think about it.

[GM] 22:19:32
And you need to talk privately amongst yourselves. She kind of rolls her eyes.

[GM] 22:19:36
Uh, I would suggest going to… Uh, Stellar burn, and going up into heaven.

[GM] 22:19:44
There's…

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:44
We could just go back to our ship, can't we? And talk about this?

[Ink] 22:19:47
We gotta get hosed off again, that's my favorite thing.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:56
Is… is heaven and the ecstasy are two different places, or the same place?

[GM] 22:19:59
Uh, Heaven is the upstairs part at Stellar Burn.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:01
Okay. Okay. I guess that makes sense.

[GM] 22:20:11
I've told Ingus to make sure there's no listening devices in heaven. I think people deserve their privacy when they… When they seek it out.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:18
Yeah, like, I trust you. Alright, fine.

[Ink] 22:20:21
I mean, I like this Yandy person.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:24
Me too.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:26
Jesus. You money-grubbing horse.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:31
I'd like to ask for one thing if we take this job, though.

[GM] 22:20:34
What's that?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:35
I don't know why you would do this, or if you would do this, but I just don't know you.

[Ink] 22:20:35
One.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:20:40
I just want assurances that the oxygen will stay on. That we just fixed.

[GM] 22:20:44
Oh. Ingus finishes up with the…

[GM] 22:20:50
The genetic scan, he… throws the finger and floats through space, sort of a…

[GM] 22:20:57
Spiraling over itself to Yandy and says, yeah, it's hers. Uh, Yandy catches it, and she says.

[GM] 22:21:03
I have no… no problem with those people down there. They've suffered long, I have rules.

[GM] 22:21:10
My rules don't extend to punishing people when they've already been punished.

[GM] 22:21:14
As long as they don't try to come up here, we can call it even.

[GM] 22:21:23
The oxygen will stay on. I don't need to… I don't need to make anybody suffer down there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:21:25
Bye.

[Ink] 22:21:29
Zeke will eternally be a hero.

[Ink] 22:21:34
They're erecting a statue made out of cardboard down there for you right now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:21:39
They're breathing on it, too, and they're like…

[Ink] 22:21:39
Yeah. They do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:41
It's made out of mud. Like, the one they made for Jane.

[Ink] 22:21:45
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:21:49
We got a song, too. Ooh, shoot. The hero of DOPTown.

[Ink] 22:21:55
It is Zeke.

[Dex Miro] 22:22:03
That's a good picture for Yandy.

[Ink] 22:22:05
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:13
Yo, man, she looks hot in this one.

[Ink] 22:22:22
And she's got modifications.

[GM] 22:22:23
She… she is surprisingly… attractive.

[GM] 22:22:27
It's disarming how attractive-looking she is.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:31
Woohoo! Again, Murderbot going.

[GM] 22:22:39
Smoke starts coming out of his ears.

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:46
Hi, we're going to talk about this? We're heading to…

[Ink] 22:22:49
Yeah, let's go, uh… let's go spend some of our 10,000 credits, right? Or half a million credits, actually.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:22:55
Did we get the advance? We didn't get the advance yet, or was that just… she just gave us that, that was a payment?

[Murderbot V2] 22:22:57
No, we got the payment for the… For the finger.

[Ink] 22:22:59
No, we got 500… we got a half a million credits for bringing the finger back and you repairing the thing downstairs.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:23:05
Oh, okay, great.

[Ink] 22:23:06
Yeah, we already got that money, right?

[GM] 22:23:08
Yes. Yes. You check your accounts. Now, it was $500,000 for all of you together, so it's only $100,000 each.

[GM] 22:23:17
Um, and then the 10,000 was also split amongst all of you, so you got.

[GM] 22:23:21
In total, um… what, 102,000?

[Ink] 22:23:25
105? 102,000 piece, yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:28
Our character sheets. This seems crazy to me.

[Ink] 22:23:45
I like this mission a lot better than the last one.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:50
Wait, are you guys taking my credits too, or… And splitting it amongst yourselves.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:55
What? No?

[Ink] 22:23:56
No, we got… well, they're still in your wallet, we don't want to let on that you're a robot yet.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:59
Alright, well, how many do I get? What do I put in here?

[GM] 22:24:02
102. 102,000.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:02
Awesome. This, yeah, these credits have nothing to do with the mods, so you would still take them anyways.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:03
102?

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:08
Under 2,000, and 20 credits. For some reason, I have.

[GM] 22:24:13
Just 20 credits. He was nearly out of, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:24
Alright, let's go. Here, I'll even splurge and get us a… give us a nice, uh, nice, nice, uh, food, nice spread of food.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:33
So…

[Ink] 22:24:34
Ooh, let me go, uh, stop by the icebox on the way to heaven, so we can get the menu of mod.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:39
Yeah, we'll do that, we'll get the price sheet, too.

[Ink] 22:24:39
The price sheet?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:24:43
Did they say what mod we're getting, or she was… Did I miss… just any mod we want.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:45
No, she said, up to $100,000 in mods. Any mods we want up to 100,000.

[Dex Miro] 22:24:46
No. Like, whatever we want.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:24:49
Okay. So it wasn't like she had one in mind that would help us with the mission, it was just, like, you can get a mod that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:50
Credit tip. No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:55
Just what you think is going to help with the mission.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:24:58
Okay.

[GM] 22:25:06
Um, alright. You're stopping by the icebox on the way? Okay. Um, so…

[Ink] 22:25:09
Just to get the price sheet, yeah.

[GM] 22:25:13
The icebox is where you would get a new sleeve, but that is not the same place as the chop shop, which is where you would get cyber mods.

[Ink] 22:25:18
Oh. Gotcha, Chop Shop, right, here we go. Ask for Babushka.

[GM] 22:25:25
Um… But you can stop by the Icebox as well. Uh, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:29
Wait, how much was the sleeve again?

[GM] 22:25:31
Sleeves. All right, Icebox services.

[GM] 22:25:37
Uh, reclamation sleeve. Built by memory wiping prisoners, uh, re-roll stats, 10% chance of learning a random skill, 10% chance of gaining someone else's memories.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:25:48
Oh, jeez. It's a little different than the advertisement.

[Ink] 22:25:49
And losing yours, or just, like, combined, yeah.

[GM] 22:25:52
That's the cheap model. The cheap model is $300,000. Model A series sleeve, bulk issue, 10 different physical models.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:56
Oh…

[GM] 22:26:02
A1 through 10. Reduce all stats and saves by 5, heavily discriminated against.

[GM] 22:26:08
That one is 500,000.

[Ink] 22:26:10
We've been discriminating against is, like, black?

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:10
Ooh… Oh, my God!

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:17
Oh my god!

[GM] 22:26:18
No, it's… it's that you look… like, there are a lot of people that look exactly the same, and you all know that that is… That is definitely a person who just got the… that base model that's like, you're just a person in a sleeve.

[GM] 22:26:33
Um, the Atlas X Premium sleeve, custom designed, plus 5 strength speed body.

[GM] 22:26:38
Recovery only takes 48 hours, 3 million credits.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:42
Oh… 2 million short, damn!

[GM] 22:26:46
No. Uh, Narcissus 1 sleeve. Luxury design, all new stats.

[GM] 22:26:53
Spend 240 points between Strength, Intellect, Combat, and Speed. Recovery only takes 12 hours. 50 million credits.

[Murderbot V2] 22:27:00
Oh! Jesus!

[GM] 22:27:06
Um… sleeve storage, monthly storage fees are 500 credits. Um… Now…

[Ink] 22:27:13
Very old sleep? You can store your old body in the case you want it in the back.

[GM] 22:27:14
What's that? Sure.

[GM] 22:27:19
Uh, in order to begin the process, you need to install a, uh… It's called Slick Drive?

[GM] 22:27:28
Slick socket. Um, which is a body modification.

[GM] 22:27:36
Now, I'm trying to… Right now, okay, there's Pound of Flesh.

[GM] 22:27:42
Okay, I'm trying to, um… see if I can copy and paste the list of mods, because…

[GM] 22:27:51
It's a lot. There are a lot of mods. Um.

[GM] 22:27:58
Let's see if I can do that. Okay, yeah, this looks like it'll work… Just give me a second so I can…

[GM] 22:28:06
Transfer this to, hopefully. Spreadsheet that will make it kind of easier to…

[GM] 22:28:34
Alright, I need a new…

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:37
I feel like we need, like, this Cyberpunk soundtrack going on in the background.

[GM] 22:28:46
No sheet. Alright, copy well? Ah, shit.

[Dex Miro] 22:28:51
The Prospero Stream Background Atmosphere, but… That would probably get old.

[GM] 22:29:00
Well, let me see, I could probably…

[Dex Miro] 22:29:01
Maybe Ink can get the AI to make the elevator music for us.

[GM] 22:29:07
Let's see how much I can fit on here. Alright, I got 32… So now I gotta do 30…

[GM] 22:29:16
3…

[GM] 22:29:27
364…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:35
33 mods!

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:39
64 mods? Is that what you just said? 33 through 64?

[GM] 22:29:44
Well, kind of. Um… Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:48
Day?

[GM] 22:29:50
Please be the right… okay.

[GM] 22:29:58
Um…

[GM] 22:30:07
On.

[GM] 22:30:12
I'm still copying… One second…

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:18
Oh my god. Oh, this is… these are the sleeves.

[GM] 22:30:34
Okay, I'm gonna share my screen, so… I can kind of read…

[GM] 22:30:41
Some of the descriptions, because the descriptions won't all feel… uh, won't all…

[GM] 22:30:49
One ounce fit? Um, let me see if I can…

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:54
Whoa.

[GM] 22:30:55
Make this a little bit better. So, reads basically, like, the name of the mod.

[GM] 22:31:03
How much it costs to install, and then… what the description is.

[GM] 22:31:09
I don't know what this 1 is, I think that these are… Um… probably…

[GM] 22:31:16
Just artifacts from copying this from a PDF into this. So, just ignore the ones and the zeros and the 3s. I don't think those are… oh, no, no, I… no, actually.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:25
Allows the user to change the primary…

[GM] 22:31:27
Those are important. Um… So let me… let me see if I can't get this a little bit more legible by…

[GM] 22:31:36
Basically… Um, I can expand out a little bit.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:44
Oh my god, that's so many.

[Dex Miro] 22:31:49
Black Puppet.

[GM] 22:31:49
Oops.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:50
Well, what do I care? I don't give a fuck.

[Murderbot V2] 22:31:57
Why do you guys get all the fun?

[Ink] 22:31:58
What if you want to be a real boy? We can upload… We can upload you into one of those ex-criminals.

[Murderbot V2] 22:32:04
I need a sleeve.

[Ink] 22:32:04
And then you get to mods. Yeah.

[GM] 22:32:10
Um… This is all from Chop Shop. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:32:10
So, all the sleeves were from Icebox, and all this stuff was from Chop Shop.

[GM] 22:32:16
So, the process by which you install cyberware. Um, basically.

[GM] 22:32:23
You're gonna go under surgery. Um, there's…

[GM] 22:32:30
Potentially significant negative impacts on your body from installing it. Um…

[GM] 22:32:38
The… but… once it's installed, uh, based on…

[GM] 22:32:45
Your…

[GM] 22:32:50
Um…

[GM] 22:32:54
Is it your intelligence? What is the… So, you'll need to… you'll need to have… okay, yeah, here it is. So, you'll need to make a body save.

[Ink] 22:32:56
Miniaturized missile launcher.

[GM] 22:33:03
As part of the installation. Um… if it's… if you fail, it's not the end of the world. If you critically fail.

[GM] 22:33:12
That's worse. Um, but it's also not the end of the world.

[GM] 22:33:17
Um, if you take Sycorax, that will help with the body save.

[GM] 22:33:21
Uh, for every 10 points of strength rounded down, you may install one piece of cyberware. So all this is cyberware.

[GM] 22:33:28
Now, you may recall I mentioned having to install a slick socket in order to down.

[GM] 22:33:34
Download. Your brain, basically. That, you know, cranial input jack, which…

[GM] 22:33:40
Allows slickware to be installed. I haven't shown you the list of slickware yet. If you'd like to see that, I will load that onto a different sheet.

[GM] 22:33:48
Here. But I'm gonna have to stop sharing my screen real quick.

[Ink] 22:33:54
Are you gonna share that… that sheet with us?

[GM] 22:33:57
Oh, yeah, I could just… I could do that. Yeah, that way you can look at it.

[GM] 22:34:01
Share. Cyberware.

[GM] 22:34:05
And slickware. Name before sharing. Okay, who do I want to give access to? I want to give access to…

[GM] 22:34:15
Uh, Zeke Mullen? I want to give access to Dex…

[GM] 22:34:20
I want to get access to my line I lacks. I want to give access to… which… which, uh, email you want, Ink?

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:24
Very nice of you. May not be necessary.

[Ink] 22:34:28
Um, do my Gmail, so N-G-I-N-G-R-I-C at gmail.com.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:31
Wait, so I'm at a complete disadvantage, because. I have to buy… I have to pay to get re-sleeved.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:39
And then I can start spending money on mods.

[Ink] 22:34:43
Well, you could potentially do slickware already, right? You already probably have a slipstream slot or whatever.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:48
Is that true, GM?

[GM] 22:34:49
Um, yes, and you also… don't need to, um, get re-sleeved first.

[Murderbot V2] 22:34:55
Oh.

[GM] 22:34:56
You're… you're, you know, these things are, you know. You might have a slight advantage to the adoption of.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:05
Mods. Oh, slickware. So let's see, let's look at the…

[GM] 22:35:05
Cyberware into your… your mod… your body being modified.

[GM] 22:35:09
Um… I'm gonna make you guys editors, but, you know. So…

[Ink] 22:35:12
But he's like a… he's like a Ken doll, though, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:13
List of slickware. Hey, easy there, man.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:18
Is it in the, uh…

[GM] 22:35:19
Alright, so you should have received a… access to the…

[GM] 22:35:26
Cyberware. And then I'll add the slickware.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:35:27
Oh, my email.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:35
And slickware.

[GM] 22:35:35
It's the square.

[GM] 22:35:40
So, the number that's on there, um… is the number of slots it takes up, so let's… if you have a particularly low body.

[Murderbot V2] 22:35:47
Slick sector.

[GM] 22:35:51
Or, I'm sorry. Was it… was it intelligence or body for the…

[GM] 22:35:56
Spaces. Oh, for every 10 points of body, or strength, sorry, strength.

[GM] 22:36:01
You may install one piece of hardware, so… If you have…

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:05
And points of strength. So I have 35… So, I would have 3 slots.

[GM] 22:36:09
Yes. So that number, like the 1, the 0… 3, whatever, those are all the… the number of slots takes up.

[GM] 22:36:17
Now, you can overclock.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:20
Ooh… But then, I'm guessing you're opening yourself up to issues?

[GM] 22:36:27
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

[Ink] 22:36:28
Like Johnny Mnemonic.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:34
GM, this says for MCR, is that 4 million? Credits? Okay, gotcha.

[GM] 22:36:37
Yes. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:40
And then the K is 1000.

[Ink] 22:36:43
I didn't get it.

[GM] 22:36:43
Killer credits, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:49
Mechanical rig… spinal rig. Assisted for heavy lifting.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:56
User gains 10 strength and 1 slot. Ooh, I can get… oh, but that's 5 million credits. Never mind.

[GM] 22:37:04
The spinal rig.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:07
Sock puppet, 1 million credit plus?

[GM] 22:37:12
Uh, the… sub… Sorry, this is so… messed up in terms of how it, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:18
Allows user to install a weapon which can fire on its own once per round using the user's combat stat, okay?

[GM] 22:37:18
Shows things, but…

[Dex Miro] 22:37:23
So, cyberware requires surgery, and Slickware just… plugs into my slick socket.

[GM] 22:37:29
Yes. Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:31
And does getting the slick socket require surgery? Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:35
Ha ha ha, sucker!

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:41
Uh, yeah, fu- I get 3 of them.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:46
I mean, if we… If we show up with some of this stuff, are we just gonna say this was part of our undercover work?

[GM] 22:37:48
Um…

[Ink] 22:37:56
Well, I like that.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:59
Because some of these things are very obvious.

[GM] 22:38:03
Some of them are quite obvious, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:07
What do you mean by that? What do you mean they're quite obvious?

[Dex Miro] 22:38:11
Like, the company would know that we had used. Well, they may or may not know that we use zephyr, but they would at least know that we got mods.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:11
They're just like… Well, like, you can see… you can see the modification.

[Ink] 22:38:48
A slick socket with only 500 credits? Okay, so that's pretty affordable. And how obvious is that?

[GM] 22:38:51
Yeah. Uh, it is… it can be pretty well hidden. Like, it's, you know, taps into, like, basically the spine and the brain.

[GM] 22:39:03
Um, so if you're just, like pull your hair over, or wear a high-collared shirt or something, no one would even notice.

[GM] 22:39:14
Um, I think I'll highlight… the names of the things?

[GM] 22:39:20
Well…

[Dex Miro] 22:39:20
I feel like Jackal's gonna want a terminal jack and some weapons that he can control with it.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:26
Not Jackal. Carnoc.

[Ink] 22:39:27
Spider Mountain.

[GM] 22:39:29
Formerly known as Jackal.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:31
Sock puppet, that's funny.

[GM] 22:39:38
This has prosthetic twice. What would it say?

[GM] 22:39:42
prosthetic…

[GM] 22:39:47
Oh, because that's the… requires. So, sometimes there's more than one word, um… And, like, underneath prosthetic, um…

[GM] 22:39:57
It says prosthetic again. So, that's what's required to have.

[GM] 22:40:03
Um, so, another example of this is underneath, um… spinal rig?

[GM] 22:40:15
Uh, the spider mount requires a spinal rig.

[Ink] 22:40:19
Oh, gotcha. The spider mode.

[GM] 22:40:21
Um… And so the… and also the…

[GM] 22:40:26
Sock puppet, which is up here. Requires a spinal rig.

[GM] 22:40:29
So it's usually the last entry, so as you're kind of going down.

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:32
And the spinal rig is pretty obvious, I'm guessing? Or no. Yeah.

[GM] 22:40:36
Yeah, like, well, it's… it's kind of, um… it's at least as obvious as, like, the… things on the back of Neo's… body, like those, like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:40:47
Oh, the sockets in the back. I'm guessing a spider, if you get a spider rig, and then a spider mount, because you have these extra…

[GM] 22:40:48
Sockets and things, like…

[Ink] 22:41:20
Three doses of poisoning.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:24
I don't know if any of these really… What would we… I guess…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:30
I'm not thinking big enough. What I… I can't even afford…

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:37
Mechanical rig. Or a whiplash injector.

[Murderbot V2] 22:41:43
I guess I could think the surveillance bug… I could do…

[Ink] 22:41:55
Where do we get rid of guys?

[GM] 22:41:58
Um, yeah, the ability to see them dark.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:01
Riddick?

[Ink] 22:42:02
You go down… what does he say when somebody asks him?

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:11
Criminal, Jack, I can do Terminal Jack, can't I? What a long interface with terminals?

[Ink] 22:42:17
Ocular graphic rendering engine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:23
How do we get terminal jack, and…

[GM] 22:42:27
Like I say, you're expanding the columns. Oh.

[Ink] 22:42:28
Oh, sorry, that was me trying to read the rest.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:31
Terminal check, and… SlickSack? Can I get a slick socket?

[GM] 22:42:34
I instantly blamed Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:36
I didn't do it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:38
What would I do with a 6… you can tell a slick socket, right, GM?

[GM] 22:42:42
You already have a slick sock at you, you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:43
Oh, okay. So I don't need… I don't need another one.

[Murderbot V2] 22:42:48
Yeah, the only thing I can afford here is… Terminal jack, Tattletale? What is detached fault? Oh, oh, okay, that's the detachable, and then the terminal deck is the audio port. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:03
Wait, did she say she would pay for slickware too, or just… Okay. How do we do this on our character sheet?

[GM] 22:43:06
Yeah, that's fine.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:13
Like, well, how do… or do we put them on our character sheets, or…

[GM] 22:43:19
Yeah. You would do it just so, you know, as a reminder.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:21
Under equipment or something?

[GM] 22:43:23
Um… I don't know where the best place would be, but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:28
Attacks equipment? Yeah.

[GM] 22:43:30
Probably under equipment.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:37
But I'm gonna add these.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:48
Well, GM, I'm just going to… Can I make modifications to the sheet?

[GM] 22:43:54
Uh, you should have editor access.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:56
Okay. I'm gonna bold the names of the…

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:02
Things, so it… Yeah, so it distinguishes itself.

[GM] 22:44:03
This liquid wears. I'm doing the cyber mods, but he's gonna do the…

[Dex Miro] 22:44:05
Somebody's turning on yellow already, right?

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:10
Oh, you're doing something with this? Oh, oh, oh, I see what you're doing. Okay, I'll do that too, then. Yellow… Or the names.

[GM] 22:44:11
Or cyberware.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:20
Why does it gotta be yellow, GM?

[GM] 22:44:23
Uh, Coldplay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:36
Sock puppet. A weapon. Allows users to insult spinal rig.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:46
Spider… spinal rig? Spinal rig? Okay, I don't know what this means, but…

[GM] 22:44:54
Um… I'm gonna help you out on the… oh!

[GM] 22:44:57
Uh, the slickware didn't copy over correctly. All that stuff is the last…

[GM] 22:45:03
Let me, uh, let me try doing that again. So I'm gonna delete all this.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:09
Okay, thanks for… clearing all the work I've done.

[GM] 22:45:13
No problemo.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:22
I don't know. I mean, I would guess… They probably all went to dinner after work, and he just thought it would be done quickly or something, I don't know.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:31
He's, like, looking around her, so he's like, I gotta get…

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:39
It'd be funny if he's like, oh, I'm tired, guys.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:45
I mean, the time zone difference makes this rough, so…

[Ink] 22:45:49
Where's he at right now?

[Dex Miro] 22:45:51
California.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:51
He's in a business…

[Ink] 22:45:54
Nice.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:57
Oh, what's God Moon? Whoa!

[Dex Miro] 22:46:00
You… if you have to ask, you can afford it.

[Ink] 22:46:03
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:04
I can afford it! It's with a… it's under the $100K, isn't it?

[Dex Miro] 22:46:08
Oh, okay. All right, I guess you can.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:09
Oh, no, it's not 10K! God mode.

[Ink] 22:46:14
Gives… gives a plus on hacking checks when jacked into a terminal.

[GM] 22:46:18
Uh, yeah, so the plus means advantage.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:23
Oh my god, I'm gonna go crazy, I'm gonna… I'm gonna ball out with all this… Slickware.

[Ink] 22:46:31
So, it seems like we all… we definitely need a slick socket, right? 500 credits, that's, you know, you gotta have one of those.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:37
Oh, yeah. There's a slickware called the Looky-loo.

[Ink] 22:46:45
What's that do?

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:46
I don't know. It picks up transmissions on all non-encrypted bands.

[Ink] 22:46:51
Yeah, that's cool.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:53
Holo pet projects a medium-sized holographic AI pet which can run around within close range. Whoa!

[Dex Miro] 22:47:05
I like that.

[Ink] 22:47:15
Psionic attack.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:23
I feel like the panic button could be very problematic.

[Ink] 22:47:26
Yeah, especially when you get knocked out. Explode.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:29
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:40
I'm assuming it's, uh… fatal to whoever has it.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:47
But maybe I'm wrong.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:49
I mean, that would have worked if we wanted to kill that person in the, uh… From that meeting we were just at.

[Ink] 22:47:57
That's… yeah, that's what I was imagining, a rig of, uh… Murderbot is a… with a panic button.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:59
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:48:05
I was just gonna short his fusion generator.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:25
I'm sure, uh… Zeke and probably wants cloak skin, but I don't think that's a Zeke thing.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:32
What do I want?

[Dex Miro] 22:48:33
Cloak skin. Near invisibility for 5 minutes once per day.

[Dex Miro] 22:48:43
It's very much your style. It doesn't say that, but I support this decision? It could lead to some funny situations.

[Ink] 22:48:44
Except we had to strip down naked to use it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:50
You know…

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:51
Yeah, different… different, uh, set of rules here.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:04
Um, all the fun stuff is too expensive.

[Ink] 22:49:07
Of course it is.

[GM] 22:49:09
Guess you're gonna have to do a job.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:15
With clash injector.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:20
4 million credits.

[GM] 22:49:22
Oh, Ink, where'd you find the, uh, sleeves?

[Ink] 22:49:25
I took the transcript that you, uh, um… what you said, and told ChatGPT to format it nicely.

[GM] 22:49:27
Oh, okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:49:35
I did read it almost verbatim. Yeah.

[Ink] 22:49:38
Yeah. I didn't check that ChatGP didn't hallucinate anything, but it looks pretty good, just glancing at it.

[GM] 22:49:43
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:49:44
It's better than my notes. The best I got was, like, putting down the prices for things, and…

[Ink] 22:49:51
Yeah. I kept putting the prices for things? Oh, yeah.

[GM] 22:49:52
You gave up after it got too expensive, you're like, fuck it.

[Ink] 22:49:58
Maybe… maybe someday, yeah. Someday.

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:58
$50 million!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:50:09
We… we get slick sockets? Okay, so I can get a socket and then project a PET.

[GM] 22:50:11
You could get a slick socket.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:13
You can get a 6 o'clock kit, although it's… it would be obvious… If you dig it, it looks like it.

[GM] 22:50:18
It would not be super obvious if you got a slick socket. It'd be easy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:20
Oh.

[Ink] 22:50:21
But you need a hollow… you need a hollow projector installed to project your holographic pet?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:50:28
Very awesome.

[Ink] 22:50:29
Oh, I see. You're just seeing… you seem crazy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:31
He's like, here, doggy doggy! There's nothing there.

[GM] 22:50:35
Oh, you're kissing me, dawg!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:50:40
Oops.

[GM] 22:50:47
Um…

[GM] 22:50:52
That is kind of weird that, yeah, you don't need a hollowed projector to be able to do the holo pet.

[Ink] 22:51:20
Looky-loo is only 550 credits?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:27
Yep, looks like it.

[GM] 22:51:28
Um, yep, 550 credits. Doesn't take up any slots either.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:33
Harry, where… is it… So, where's the stuff from before?

[GM] 22:51:38
What do you mean?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:40
There was, like, a… Well, it was, like, the rig…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:49
I can't remember what the heck what the stuff was before. Like, a mechanical rig or something like that, or… spinal rig…

[Dex Miro] 22:51:57
The sleeves? What?

[GM] 22:52:00
You know, there's two things at the bottom?

[Ink] 22:52:03
It's cyberware versus slickware. You're talking about cyberware now, Murderbot?

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:07
Oh, that's cyberware? Because it was in the… under the slickware stuff, wasn't it?

[GM] 22:52:09
Yeah. It was. I… I… I…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:13
Oh, oh, you just… oh, oh, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

[GM] 22:52:15
I copied the wrong column into the Slickware. Yeah. So yeah, if you go back to the Cyberware…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:17
Ah, gotcha, okay, okay. Okay, so this is actual… Slickware.

[GM] 22:52:23
Yes, the… Yeah, the thing beginning with God… God mode is all, like, internal, just…

[Dex Miro] 22:52:24
I think…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:24
Okay, okay, the other stuff was cyberware before, because I was…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:31
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I was… I was looking…

[GM] 22:52:31
Programs, essentially. Whereas the CyberWare's modifications of your physical form.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:38
I was… I was… I was craving the wrong stuff. I was, like, desiring the wrong stuff, now I gotta look at this stuff and see if I can owe… Before doing this shit. Which I can't…

[GM] 22:52:49
I'm getting forward quite a bit. Into a big switch, dead switch.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:51
Can I? Hold on, let's see. Twitch! Twitch Booster…

[GM] 22:52:54
Fangs, hand cannon if you get…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:58
Vox box, Twitch Booster. Skills… skills…

[GM] 22:53:02
Hot swap…

[Murderbot V2] 22:53:03
Skillslick… set… not Sentinel. Looky-loo.

[Murderbot V2] 22:53:09
Don't know why I need a Hello Pet.

[Ink] 22:53:11
Um, why… GM, are they in the four columns for a particular reason that I'm missing?

[GM] 22:53:15
I just, uh, I was trying to fit them all on the screen.

[Ink] 22:53:19
Oh, I see.

[GM] 22:53:20
For when I was just sharing screen, then, you know, whoever had the brilliant idea for me to just share it with you guys, I mean… I would have probably just made them all one column at that point, but…

[Ink] 22:53:31
Is it okay if we move into one call?

[GM] 22:53:32
Yeah, go for it. I'm gonna grab some water, so I'll be right back.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:53:37
I'll be right back to you.

[Ink] 22:54:20
Is the, uh, the one that's how many slots it requires?

[GM] 22:54:23
Yes.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:24
So, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:30
Machine code sentinel system.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:35
Slick socket. The skill slick.

[Ink] 22:54:38
Well, this probably did make sense there.

[GM] 22:54:41
The last line is typically, um… you know, a requirement that you need to have.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:45
All what you need.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:46
Great rocks.

[Ink] 22:54:52
So the slicks… oh wait, okay. Did I… so I did, I did the big switch correctly there?

[Ink] 22:54:57
As my example.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:57
Yeah, I think it just didn't have any prerequisites, and that's also the reason why they got kind of misaligned is… Relative to each other is because, um…

[GM] 22:55:03
Yeah, I'm gonna shrink these columns down, though, because you don't… We'll make them a little bit wider, but… You don't need them, has…

[Ink] 22:55:06
Yeah, that's cool.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:09
Alright, I'm gonna… I'm gonna change this up to GM, if you don't mind.

[GM] 22:55:13
Yes, go for it. Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:14
Be formatted.

[Ink] 22:55:14
Then I need… I need… we need one more column that is prerequisites.

[Ink] 22:55:17
Colin?

[Dex Miro] 22:55:18
Good. Yeah, should we put that before description and just get… yeah.

[GM] 22:55:21
Cyberware cost, slots, description requirements. There should be… 2, 3, 4…

[GM] 22:55:29
Yep.

[GM] 22:55:34
I'll start working from the bottom.

[Ink] 22:55:56
The cloak skin was also 200,000 credits there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:12
How do you formats of cells? Let's here…

[Dex Miro] 22:56:17
A mental trigger is just a… voluntary…

[Dex Miro] 22:56:24
You just think it or something? A mental trigger is just, like, a voluntary, you just think about it and it happens sort of thing.

[GM] 22:56:26
Which one, Dex?

[GM] 22:56:34
Is that under Slickware?

[Dex Miro] 22:56:35
Well, things just say, like, takes one day and a mental trigger, or something like that.

[GM] 22:56:42
Yeah, I guess you just think it.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:44
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:57:00
Now, do you look like a vampire if you get the fangs?

[Dex Miro] 22:57:04
What does it mean if it says 200 credits plus?

[GM] 22:57:11
Um, maybe there's something specific to…

[Dex Miro] 22:57:17
Oh, it's the Lumatat, or whatever, so maybe there's different kinds of tattoos, and some of them cost more.

[Ink] 22:57:28
I'm not sure how to do the hand cannon one.

[GM] 22:57:34
Some of the, um, description gets pushed onto multiple lines, so you could just kinda… Smash them together.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:43
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:57
Local to him canon.

[Ink] 22:57:58
Yeah, the hand kind of didn't… I didn't understand I have Weapon, and then varies were the two things.

[GM] 22:58:03
Yeah, so the hand cannon, um… Let's see… the way they have it is…

[GM] 22:58:10
Uh, 6 kilo credits plus weapon. So, like. It's 6 kilo credits to install, plus the cost of whatever the weapon is, which could vary if you're gonna do a pulse rifle versus a…

[GM] 22:58:21
Smg or something. Uh, so the number of slots varies. Uh, I don't have that on here, but essentially.

[Ink] 22:58:21
Gotcha.

[GM] 22:58:28
Slots for the weapons, handguns are one slot, rifles are two slots, larger than rifles, 3 plus slots.

[Ink] 22:58:37
Interesting. And, like, does it look like you have a gun hand?

[Ink] 22:58:43
No, it's conceals what tied the product up. So I go like this, and it pops out the top, and…

[GM] 22:58:44
No, it's concealed in a prosthetic one.

[GM] 22:58:49
Yeah.

[GM] 22:59:00
Spinal rig…

[Dex Miro] 22:59:15
It has rather undesirable behavior when other people deliver us.

[GM] 22:59:19
Yeah, who's deleting those roles? It's just, it's hard to copy the things, because they're bouncing around.

[Ink] 22:59:21
Oh, shoot, my screen thing is up. Oh, because it shifts on you, I'm sorry.

[GM] 22:59:27
Yeah, it's alright.

[Dex Miro] 22:59:46
What's calling me?

[Ink] 22:59:47
Uh, I was gonna, like, add kind of extras here, something like that, before description.

[Ink] 22:59:52
Um, I don't know if there'd be, like, a better… so that's gonna be, like, plus…

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:01
What is loudmouth? Was that, like, a…

[Dex Miro] 23:00:05
That sounds awesome.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:06
Is that something in, um… In cyberware?

[Dex Miro] 23:00:11
Yeah. I mean, that's… Loudmouth is just the basic, like, recording and playback, and then there was another thing that allowed you to, like.

[GM] 23:00:11
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:19
Oh, no, this… it's cause this… one of the slick wares requires it.

[Dex Miro] 23:00:21
Take the samples of people's voices and synthesize it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:24
And I was like, what? Moses is liquid required slick socket, but not a… actual hardware thing yet, so…

[Ink] 23:00:37
Yeah, we can get credit for quite a few things, can't we?

[GM] 23:00:40
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:42
Within the budget.

[Ink] 23:00:44
GM, this… the, uh, the missions that you've sent us on.

[Ink] 23:00:49
Um, are they in a particular order that most people do, or how does it… How did you decide on them?

[GM] 23:01:03
I rolled randomly for you guys to find Imogene Kane, and it kind of just went from there.

[Ink] 23:01:07
Okay.

[GM] 23:01:10
There's a D10 table for… Um, cyber… our canyon-heavy missions.

[GM] 23:01:17
I just happened to roll. 4. Contact Imogene Kane.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:31
Like South Covid should also have… Open cost, yeah.

[Ink] 23:01:34
Yep, you got it, you know that.

[GM] 23:01:51
Just get a straight up… Couple of master skills, got enough intelligence.

[GM] 23:02:20
Yeah, you ever have a slick socket. Do you have a terminal jack, though? Hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:20
Do androids have terminal jacks?

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:26
Yeah, yeah.

[GM] 23:02:27
That's a good question. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:33
I would think so? No? Okay. Because one of the things requires… one of the slickware requires it.

[GM] 23:02:35
Probably. Port allowing interface…

[Ink] 23:02:41
What's the difference between us? A slick socket and a terminal jack.

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:46
So, terminal jack, I think, is a… it's in the cyberware.

[Ink] 23:02:50
It's like your finger opens up and it's a USB port.

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:55
What is terminal jack? Port allowing interface with terminals, smart link weapons and vehicles can download data from link systems or upload from a black box.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:04
I gotta have one of those.

[GM] 23:03:07
Sure, yeah, you have those. I'll be right back.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:09
Alright, so I don't need that.

[Ink] 23:03:15
Is this somebody's wish list down here, the God Mode EFL?

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:19
Oh, yeah, I was just, like, uh, copying and pasting.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:27
Where did I fill?

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:34
Sorry.

[Ink] 23:03:37
I just didn't want to delete it. I was like, what is that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:51
I suppose I should make my own. Oh, someone's… someone's doing some formatting for me. Thank you, Sue.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:17
Black box. I need a black box, too. I wonder if I have a black box as well.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:25
Nope, I'm guessing I don't have a black box.

[Ink] 23:04:28
I like that. At a level the AI finds comfortable.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:41
Let's ask GM if I have a black box.

[Ink] 23:04:44
Why not? You definitely should.

[GM] 23:04:47
We're going back. No, you don't have one of those.

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:48
GM, do I have a black box as well? Damn it!

[Murderbot V2] 23:04:56
Try to push the limits here.

[GM] 23:04:58
No, why do they need to make a black box? The company's just gonna replace you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:02
Uh, well, wouldn't they want to see, like, go through my, uh, all the things that happened to me?

[Ink] 23:05:07
It's different than his memory core, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:08
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:14
Zeke, you look distressed. Are you distressed? What's… what's wrong?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:17
I'm distressed. I don't know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:22
It's wrong? Thank you for being concerned.

[Ink] 23:05:29
Allows the user to smooth or roughen their appearance.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:34
Really feel like all of these are two categories, like cheap and terrible, or.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:40
Great, expensive. There's really no medium.

[Dex Miro] 23:05:44
There's absolutely mediums. Uh, oh, what was… well, what was the other one?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:05:47
What is a medium?

[Dex Miro] 23:05:52
The thing that required the…

[Dex Miro] 23:05:57
Yeah, what was the thing that required the loudmouth? Well, that's the query?

[Ink] 23:06:02
That lets you then speak, uh. In other people's voices?

[Ink] 23:06:07
The VoxBox? Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:10
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I think the combination of the VoxBox and the loudmouth is pretty good.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:20
The… in the what?

[Dex Miro] 23:06:23
The VoxBox, where you can, like. Have people's voices say… whatever, as long as you have enough samples.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:29
Yeah. And the which other one?

[Dex Miro] 23:06:34
Well, the loudmouth is just the prerequisite of the box box to get the basic, like, record and playback for voice.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:37
Oh, okay. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:42
But, like, that's… that's decent, and it's not… it's only, like, a quarter of your budget.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:48
Decent.

[Ink] 23:06:49
GM, I really don't get how the hollow pet can work without the, uh, hollow projector.

[GM] 23:06:53
Could be a typo.

[Ink] 23:06:55
Okay, I think, yeah, I mean, the holo projector's cheap enough that it probably should be a pre-web for it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:59
Do we add that in there? And you do… you do that.

[GM] 23:07:00
All right, make it, make it so. Now, you can all blame Ink, he has to spend 750 more credits to get a holo pet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:09
We could have all had, like, the decoys, we could have all had decoys!

[Ink] 23:07:10
I want to holler back to you anyway.

[Ink] 23:07:19
You know, how big can a projector project?

[GM] 23:07:23
Actually, I guess you need the ogre in order to have the hollow Protector, so…

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:29
Oh, shit.

[Ink] 23:07:30
Yeah, you could have a hollow projector, it just wouldn't… it'd be pretty worthless without all those things, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:34
Alright, clear out that their hollow projector is required.

[GM] 23:07:39
No, it's fine. I mean… to…

[Ink] 23:07:41
Well, you can collect it via Ogre, installed body cam, black box, or slick socket, right? You could project any data from any of those type of things.

[GM] 23:07:49
Yeah, so it makes sense that you'd be able to project.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:50
Yeah.

[GM] 23:07:53
Holo pet. If you had that installed.

[GM] 23:07:56
So… Yeah.

[Ink] 23:08:07
Right, so who's getting their slick socket first?

[GM] 23:08:12
Pj's already got one.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:13
Yep, I'm just looking at my slickware. GM, what is this… User gains the purchased skill.

[Dex Miro] 23:08:15
Technically hadn't, I guess.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:21
For as long as the skillslick remains installed. The selection and supply of skill slicks is very limited and closely guarded.

[GM] 23:08:33
Um, so all the… all the skills that you can have as a character.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:34
Skillslick?

[GM] 23:08:40
You can basically purchase those. Using Skillslick.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:44
Oh, meaning the… Oh, that's where the trained expert master. Okay, gotcha.

[GM] 23:08:49
So, if you buy a… Right, right. So all train skills are roughly 50,000.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:51
Alright, so, like, if I don't have one, then I can… add that for $50,000 for a train. Okay, gotcha.

[GM] 23:08:55
Yeah. Now, note those also require slots, and you… for slickware, you need to have… for every 10 points of intel… intellect.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:05
Right, I only get 3 slots for my… Right? Total? Oh, wait.

[GM] 23:09:10
I don't know. No, no, it's intellect. It's a whole separate… Yeah, for slickware.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:12
Oh, it's not… it's not strength, it's intellect. Ooh, all right, I got 4 slots.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:26
And I get a looky-loo, because a looky-loo doesn't require a… a slot, right? Is that right?

[GM] 23:09:34
Uh, looky-loo does not require a slot.

[Dex Miro] 23:09:48
How many slots do we have again?

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:50
Uh, the number, uh… It's 10 intellect per 1 slot.

[GM] 23:09:56
And 10 strength per 1 slot for… Cyberware.

[GM] 23:10:14
Does anyone know what they want? They can go under the knife first.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:23
I mean, do you have to do it all at once?

[GM] 23:10:26
Uh, it's recommended you do it all at once.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:10:31
There's a sex change one make you look entirely different? So, like, a disguise, basically?

[GM] 23:10:37
I would assume so. Imagine your face is exactly the same, but everything else is…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:10:46
Oh, you know, it could be bad.

[GM] 23:10:59
I mean, evolutionarily, there are certain features of… Yeah. Men and women that are slightly different.

[GM] 23:11:07
Based on their sex, so…

[GM] 23:11:13
That's also genetic selection, too.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:11:18
Those would change your DNA?

[GM] 23:11:22
Uh, I must allow flipping.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:11:25
And change back, presumably? Or is it a one-time thing?

[GM] 23:11:31
No, you could do it multiple times. Takes one hour and a mental trigger.

[GM] 23:11:38
I imagine that the process is probably not… super comfortable.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:42
Yeah, that's gotta be an interesting hour.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:11:42
Yeah.

[GM] 23:11:46
Have you guys seen, um… It's not the stuff. What is it? That's the Demean Moore movie that just came out.

[GM] 23:11:54
Um, the substance. Okay. It's a horror movie.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:58
No.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:00
Oh, I read… I've seen clips of it, yeah.

[GM] 23:12:01
It's good. Got some body horror in it.

[GM] 23:12:08
It's kind of like that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:11
Yeah, you know.

[Ink] 23:12:21
Right? Does anybody have their slick socket yet? Other than Murderbot?

[Ink] 23:12:32
So we decided we're going to take this, uh… this gig?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:38
Yeah, we haven't even talked about that yet. It's been enthralled with the store.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:41
Well, here's my question. What is… we're… if we go after the company.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:43
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:49
I'm guessing the company's gonna come after us.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:54
Yeah, almost for sure.

[Ink] 23:12:54
Well, we just go there, we give them information. We leave the suitcase, the whole place blows up, they don't know we did it, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:01
How can they not? It's on… it's in our ship. No?

[Ink] 23:13:06
We're not gonna announce it, right? There's no evidence. The whole place blows up.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:10
Well, the ship's gonna blow up. Our ship's gonna blow up, isn't it?

[Ink] 23:13:11
Yeah, go ahead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:13:13
That's why when… that's why when you're done with the operation, we just all change our sexes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:18
Well, wait, hold on. If the ship blows up, where the hell are we gonna go?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:13:20
Say it

[Ink] 23:13:22
No, we're on our ship. We leave.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:24
Always, so you're saying we get on our ship with a suitcase, and then when we… Go to the company, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:13:26
That's…

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:33
We're just gonna bring the thing into the corporate offices or something like that? Is that right?

[Ink] 23:13:37
Yeah, we're… we're about…

[Dex Miro] 23:13:38
Yeah, this is the part of the plan that concerns me, is, like.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:42
Like, they're not gonna have any, like, metal detectors or scanners, or…

[Dex Miro] 23:13:43
Well, can we just leave, or do we have to wait for the company to send us on another mission, and then, like, say this CEO guy shows up?

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:51
And he's, like, modded to the max.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:51
They're just gonna press the button, they don't care that we're still on the station.

[Ink] 23:13:57
So, we need to, one, an excuse to get out of there for the company, right?

[Ink] 23:14:01
Like, almost like our mission's not done yet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:06
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:07
I mean, can we just… can we have, like, a backup ship waiting for us somehow? Like, just hire a…

[Ink] 23:14:12
Why don't we need a backup ship?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:14:15
Um, I guess that's true, right? We can just take this… well, are we dropping the suitcase off? Is that what we're doing?

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:19
I have… I'm telling you 100% that once we drop off that package and that thing blows up, we are gonna be hunted by the company.

[Ink] 23:14:19
Yeah, so the bot…

[Ink] 23:14:28
But nobody will know. They don't know how this shit, the thing…

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:29
How would they not know? We came, and then the place blew up, and we left.

[Ink] 23:14:34
And… and the place that was recording all of that blew up, so who's gonna know?

[Ink] 23:14:43
I mean, they never found… they never found the 9-11 black boxes, Murderbot Kim. Why would they find…

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:43
Well, I don't know if it's that simple, but…

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:53
Touche, touche.

[GM] 23:14:58
I'll be right back.

[Ink] 23:14:59
Well, the plan is expected is we're gonna… we're gonna travel back to the company.

[Ink] 23:15:02
With a suitcase and some potentially really juicy information. Right?

[Ink] 23:15:08
We walk into the company's ship. And we say, we got this juicy information.

[Ink] 23:15:13
To attract a CEO to come to the company ship. Right? Then that CEO comes, we drop the suitcase somewhere on the ship, we don't care, we can say it's in the suitcase.

[Ink] 23:15:24
And then we have to have an excuse to get out of there.

[Ink] 23:15:27
And then when we leave, the suitcase blows up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:32
What if… I mean, what if he comes aboard our ship, right? Does he take the suitcase with him?

[Ink] 23:15:37
Our ship's a piece of garbage. Nobody wants to go aboard our ship.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:39
Okay.

[Ink] 23:15:40
Yeah, the CEO is… he's… it's like a… getting into your used Honda Civic, right, or something like that.

[Ink] 23:15:46
He ain't gonna do that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:46
Right.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:49
Yeah, I just… my concern is just, I don't know if the company's just gonna let us leave.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:15:54
Oh, I mean, I think there's a good chance they'll know it's us at some point. I mean…

[Murderbot V2] 23:15:58
I think there's an excellent chance they know it's us.

[Ink] 23:16:04
Well, I say we take Phoenix with us, that little, uh, rat bastard, and we pin it all on him.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:09
Yeah. Swap the suitcase out for a trout.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:16
Well, that's not the one we brought back.

[Ink] 23:16:26
So our other option is to go turn on Yandy, then.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:32
I mean… you know, none of the options are safe.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:37
This one pays a lot more, so the question is, do we feel any ethical obligation to.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:44
You know, take out the drug dealers versus take out the company, so to speak.

[Ink] 23:16:49
It doesn't sound like traditional drug dealers, right? It's not like you get addicted to, uh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:16:54
Right.

[Ink] 23:16:55
The stuff, and, like, you're hooked on it, and they wanted to do it. No, it's a… It's a medical drug that allows modifications.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:17:01
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:17:07
So yeah, I'm on… We're more… we're flipping on the company for more than just money, it seems like.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:17:14
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:17:20
Yeah. I don't know how we get on our ship and head off to the next mission.

[Ink] 23:17:23
But, potentially, they're gonna give us another mission, right?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:17:27
What they said, means they intend for us to survive. Oh, the company.

[Ink] 23:17:31
No, the company. We show up and we say, hey, we've completed this mission.

[Ink] 23:17:35
You know, here's whatever information. She said we could tell him about Yandy, right? GM? What did she tell we could say to her, the company?

[GM] 23:17:43
She effectively said that she'd give you something that would be worth.

[GM] 23:17:47
Drawing their attention.

[Ink] 23:17:48
But what can we say as far as completing our mission, as far as the drug, and who's running it?

[GM] 23:17:54
Oh, I don't think she gave you any limits in terms of… what, uh… what you could say there.

[Ink] 23:18:01
Okay. So it could fabricate something, we could… Tell something close to the truth.

[GM] 23:18:06
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:18:08
To help complete our mission. Do we, um, we need some proof that we've completed our mission?

[Ink] 23:18:12
To the company, to a certain extent. I mean, like. Well, how do they…

[GM] 23:18:15
Yeah, that seems to be what she's planning to provide you.

[Ink] 23:18:20
Okay. So that, in addition to the really high-level thing, or that will be high-level enough to attract the CEO?

[GM] 23:18:28
That's… that should be high level enough to attract the… CEO.

[Ink] 23:18:31
Okay. Gotcha. So she's gonna provide us information to a… to attract a CEO, which also completes, conveniently completes our mission with the company.

[Ink] 23:18:39
How much does the company pay us for completing our mission?

[GM] 23:18:40
Yeah. Uh… I think they erased your debts or something?

[GM] 23:18:48
I, uh… I'll be right back.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:18:48
Yeah, deep bastards.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:50
Yeah. Did you expect anything else based on your, uh… previous experience.

[Ink] 23:18:50
Okay.

[Ink] 23:18:55
Fortunately, I don't owe anything, so I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:59
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:19:04
I didn't bonk my head on anything or jack myself into any AIs.

[Ink] 23:19:08
I burned a glass.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:09
Warming. So the original plan was that we were just supposed to figure out who the leaders were.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:13
And then they're gonna go back and do something to get rid of them.

[Ink] 23:19:17
Potential. They didn't tell us what they're doing.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:18
So… so that… Probably is our next mission.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:22
At least, assuming… Phoenix doesn't come with us.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:26
For one reason or another, that we would have to get them back to Prospero's dream.

[Ink] 23:19:38
Yeah, I get it. It seems like… If we have… because we didn't just… we didn't kill… the person that was in charge of it or anything like that.

[Ink] 23:19:45
So I guess we could propose another mission to go back.

[GM] 23:19:49
Alright, I'm… back.

[GM] 23:20:02
Yes. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:02
GM? I think I know what I'm gonna do.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:10
Um… I've decided to do… Can I… can I go over the $100,000 and make it up with my own credits?

[GM] 23:20:19
Yes.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:20
Okay. So, I'm gonna add God Mode.

[GM] 23:20:28
Okay?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:32
Um… that's… a Espernetic feedback loop?

[GM] 23:20:42
Okay?

[Ink] 23:20:44
Espernetic… yeah, how else do you say that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:48
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:53
Vox box.

[GM] 23:20:55
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:20:57
Wait, are they covering up to $100K, or is it… Is it just, like, one… okay, so we can just, like, keep selecting until…

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:59
Yeah, they set up to… oh. Up to 100K.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:05
Uh, looky-loo. Which… which is low…

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:11
Um… no slots. I get 4.

[Ink] 23:21:14
How many slots does he get? And that's based on your intelligence?

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:18
Yep. And then, I'm gonna do a skill slick. And that's gonna be piloting.

[GM] 23:21:22
Yep.

[Ink] 23:21:30
That's cool.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:34
And that's my 4. And I go… I'm going over by… $20,550.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:45
So I'm just going to subtract that from my 102. Okay.

[GM] 23:21:47
Okay. Sure.

[Ink] 23:21:50
And so, it was 10… every 10 intelligence, you get a slot.

[GM] 23:21:56
Uh, every 10 intellect, you get one slot for slickware.

[Murderbot V2] 23:21:56
Yep.

[Ink] 23:21:59
Gotcha. So how many… how much intelligence does… Murderbot have?

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:05
44.

[Ink] 23:22:06
You had 4 slots, okay. We'll get to round up.

[GM] 23:22:09
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:13
Well, seeing as though he gave me a terminal jack and I did need to buy one of those and get them installed.

[Ink] 23:22:17
Yeah, that was good. No, I'm only at 37, so I only have 3 slots, so I'm just short.

[Ink] 23:22:22
I put the right… for some reason, I thought we'd be running a lot, so I put my max in speed.

[Ink] 23:22:26
I'm very fast.

[GM] 23:22:30
Um, alright.

[GM] 23:22:36
Where do you… do you get it… do you get slickware installed at?

[GM] 23:22:40
Icebox… I think the slickware is installed at the icebox.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:42
What's up?

[Ink] 23:22:48
The chop shop will install at the port, but the slickware's…

[GM] 23:22:50
The cyberware, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:22:52
Oh.

[GM] 23:22:58
Dreams, Iceboxes, Dream Slang term for highly illegal synthetic sleeving facility in Slick Bay venue.

[GM] 23:23:08
SlickBays, hundreds of human-sized pods. Where users can enter a virtual slick world for education, escape, and pleasure.

[GM] 23:23:18
While logged into the SlickBay, users can install Slickware as per the rules on page 17.

[GM] 23:23:25
Alright, you ready to undergo slickware installation? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:30
Me? Wait, I have to roll for this? Oh, my fu-!

[Dex Miro] 23:23:31
Yeah, it's better.

[GM] 23:23:33
Yes.

[Ink] 23:23:37
Things can go wrong, your brain gets fried!

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:40
Son of a gun, I thought this was just automatic, like a quick imp.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:45
Outpatient, in and out. The old in-out, in-out.

[GM] 23:23:47
Oh… It's too late now, you've just… you've just jacked in.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:50
Fuck me. Better!

[GM] 23:23:54
He made it.

[Ink] 23:23:56
Hey!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:23:58
Sorry.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:59
Alright, what do I roll? Well, just in time to watch me get operated on.

[GM] 23:23:59
Um… you're just… you're just in time. Uh…

[Dex Miro] 23:24:06
Yeah.

[GM] 23:24:06
Okay. Selling slickware. Right. Uh, requires the sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:07
We need to catch up pattern on all this stuff, anyway.

[GM] 23:24:14
At Advantage.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:14
Sanity save. Sanity safe…

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:19
Oh, sorry, hold on. Sanity safe…

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:27
Advantage.

[GM] 23:24:30
Okay, we succeed. This is not a critical success.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:32
Woohoo!

[GM] 23:24:38
Um…

[GM] 23:24:45
Okay.

[GM] 23:24:53
Um, okay. Uh, alright.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:54
Sound good? For all of them, or do you want me to roll for each?

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:01
Installation.

[GM] 23:25:02
Uh, I think probably just once. That's why it's advised that you do it just once.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:07
Okay.

[GM] 23:25:08
Alright, um, you plug in, um… Did anyone go to observe Murderbot getting all this installed?

[GM] 23:25:15
Yeah, you're sitting there watching? Okay. All right. Uh…

[Ink] 23:25:15
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:18
They just want to see me suffer!

[GM] 23:25:22
Alright, Ink, would you see is Murderbot plugs in, and it kind of goes limp.

[GM] 23:25:28
Um, and… Then, he begins convulsing.

[GM] 23:25:34
And, uh… It doesn't look like things are going well. Steam starts coming out of his ears.

[Ink] 23:25:42
Block. No!

[GM] 23:25:44
A technician who works at the. The icebox runs over and is like, what the fuck? What's going on?

[GM] 23:25:50
What are you doing?

[Ink] 23:25:53
Oh, shit, he doesn't know that he's a robot!

[Murderbot V2] 23:25:56
Oh, my fucking god.

[GM] 23:25:58
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, man! That's an android in there? What'd you do that for? Why'd you plug that in?

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:05
Oh my god. Oh my god…

[GM] 23:26:06
Oh, God, unplug them, we gotta get them to the babushka!

[GM] 23:26:12
Uh, you guys unplug his body and rush him over to the chop shop.

[Ink] 23:26:16
He says, I get all his stuff if he dies, though.

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:19
Oh my god…

[GM] 23:26:22
Um… She's like, so, you come into this, it's, uh…

[GM] 23:26:28
Kind of a rundown facility. Um, there's large, loud squawks, as if there were birds squawking at you, uh, when you enter.

[GM] 23:26:35
It's like a… there's a hollow pet that's a bird, uh, that's like a… Parrot. Um, then a hologram of a child appears.

[GM] 23:26:46
And says, Hi, welcome to the Chop Shop. How can I help you today?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:26:52
Error…

[GM] 23:26:55
Um…

[Ink] 23:26:55
For murder… Murderbot… previous DexBot is…

[Ink] 23:27:01
Malfunctioning.

[GM] 23:27:03
Um, yeah, the attendant from the icebox is with you, and is like, they plugged an Android into this, like, where?

[GM] 23:27:09
Uh, then the Slick Bay. Oh, shit. Well, let me see if the babushka's ready for you, um, and disappears.

[GM] 23:27:18
Um, and then moments later. An older woman, um…

[GM] 23:27:23
Who walks with a cane, um… Kane looks… fairly like a sawed-off shotgun.

[GM] 23:27:33
Um, walks into the room, says. Bring them back. Just got kind of, like, a throaty, um…

[GM] 23:27:40
Voice as if she's smoked a lot. Um, you take Murderbot past, like, several dingy rooms, um.

[GM] 23:27:49
And, uh, operating rooms and also recovery rooms. There's blood. Try blood just everywhere. It's just all over the place. This is not sanitary, to say the least.

[GM] 23:28:00
Uh, you lay Murderbot's body down in one of the… Um…

[GM] 23:28:08
Cyber mod Rooms. Um…

[GM] 23:28:13
The rooms are… there's, like, people in all of the different rooms. Uh, some of them looks like they're recovering.

[GM] 23:28:20
Some of them look as if they might even be dead.

[GM] 23:28:26
She… goes to work as if she's knowledgeable about androids?

[GM] 23:28:31
Uh, she pushed us a couple things and starts fiddling around on the inside of Murderbot.

[GM] 23:28:37
Um… snorts and kind of laughs to herself, and she's like…

[GM] 23:28:43
What the fuck were you trying to do? Uh, sort of asking rhetorically, but then also asking.

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:47
But I didn't… even I didn't know, right? Or did I?

[GM] 23:28:50
I guess ink is there? Do you know what the fuck he was doing?

[Ink] 23:28:52
Yep. Uh, we're trying to get him some slickware. He wanted some god mode.

[GM] 23:29:01
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 23:29:02
Uh, Espernetic Feedback Loop. But it's looky-loo, and he wanted to be, uh, skill slick with a little bit better piloting.

[GM] 23:29:10
Okay. Um, did you know he's also got a panic button solved?

[GM] 23:29:17
And an ogre? And this is all property of the company?

[Ink] 23:29:19
I didn't… I did not know he had that installed, no.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:24
It was a panic by itself.

[GM] 23:29:27
Uh, yeah. This is… this is… this is an assassin bot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:34
That's why his name's Murderbot.

[Ink] 23:29:38
I thought that was just… Joe!

[GM] 23:29:43
Um, yeah, he overclocked himself, uh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:29:48
Explains the murder and the pot.

[GM] 23:29:50
Okay. And that's where we're gonna stop. Sorry, Carnoc!

[Ink] 23:29:56
So he already, like, had too much crap installed in him.

[GM] 23:29:59
Yep. Um, no, we'll have to figure out, like, some of the slickware's probably fine, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:01
I just didn't know it.

[GM] 23:30:08
Because you're only really doing slickware right, Murderbot?

[Ink] 23:30:12
Yeah. I thought those… I thought the slots were different for slickware versus, uh, cyberware.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:12
Yeah, I was just doing slickware because that's all I could do.

[GM] 23:30:17
They are, they are, and that's…

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:18
Yeah, intelligence, and then… hardware is strength.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:23
Is that what you're saying?

[GM] 23:30:25
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um.

[GM] 23:30:29
You also had a holo pet installed that you didn't know about.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:35
What the fuck? Why don't I know these things?

[GM] 23:30:41
Um. Carnoc, in your email, you'll see, uh, I shared a document with you with regards to, uh.

[GM] 23:30:47
The costs of installing cyber modifications, including. Slickware, which is essentially, like.

[GM] 23:30:55
I don't know what, mental upgrades? Not physical upgrades.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:58
Yeah.

[GM] 23:31:00
Um, I have to go take my dog. To the backyard, so you guys can fill Carnoc in with what happened.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:31:06
I'll have to read Dex's journals.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:06
Okay.

[Ink] 23:31:11
So, we, uh, we went to talk to… Uh, the lady, what's the lady's name? I can't remember her name.

[Dex Miro] 23:31:18
The Andy, right? Is that right? Oh, yeah.

[Ink] 23:31:19
Imogene, we're talking to Imogene Kane, right? So, we left off last time where we fixed up the, um, the air purifier. What do we call the thing?

[Dex Miro] 23:31:29
I don't know, it was just some atmospheric processor thing.

[Ink] 23:31:31
Have a strict process. Yeah, so we prepared the atmospheric processor, um, Zeke pulled that off, we went back to Imogene Kane, she was pretty happy, she's like, I'm no longer an attack upstairs.

[Ink] 23:31:40
And then she gave us kind of the rundown of who is who up there.

[Ink] 23:31:44
And mostly… and then she chopped her finger off to prove that she was no longer a threat and handed that to us, and said, go collect your 10,000 credits.

[Ink] 23:31:51
Um, and so pretty much there was not much more to go with her. She told us that Yandy is in charge of the drugs.

[Ink] 23:31:57
Um, well, and Yandy's in charge of everything, Ukko-Ukka makes the drugs, who is the… the person, I think, in the solar church.

[Ink] 23:32:07
Um, and that was kind of… that was, uh, a little bit of Imogene's friend.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:07
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:32:12
Um, so then, as we're leaving, everybody was worshiping Zeke and breathing on Zeke.

[Ink] 23:32:17
Because Zeke fixed atmospheric… Um, you know, atmospheric, uh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:32:18
Most important part of the story.

[Ink] 23:32:23
Whatever thing, processor thing. Um, as soon as we got back upstairs, a bunch of armed guards included 13 people.

[Ink] 23:32:30
Armed people came, plus two of them were in exoskeleton suits, and they were looking for Zeke.

[Ink] 23:32:35
Um, and so we went willingly with Zeke, and they took us to Yandy, who runs the station.

[Ink] 23:32:41
And so, Andy's the… Um, the good-looking girl in the chat.

[Ink] 23:32:46
Here at the very bottom of the chat there. And then Yandy says, I know why you guys are here.

[Ink] 23:32:53
Um, Phoenix told on us. And, um, we gave the finger and stuff to Yandy, and Yandy gave us $500.

[Ink] 23:33:03
1,000 credits instead of. 10,000 credits for going and finding imaging, and for pairing the air purifier, and for kind of resolving their…

[Ink] 23:33:15
Their conflict there. So she's pretty happy with that. Yeah, so add a hundred and… is it 105 or 102?

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:17
So you get 100K.

[Ink] 23:33:23
We've still got the 10,000 on top of the 500. So yeah, so I had 102 to your character sheet.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:23
$102,000.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:23
Put it in two, yeah.

[Ink] 23:33:30
Um, so then… 102,000 credits.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:33:32
2,000?

[Dex Miro] 23:33:33
102,000.

[Ink] 23:33:36
So then Yandy, uh, said.

[Dex Miro] 23:33:38
If you're thinking this is a suspiciously large amount of money, then I agree.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:43
Wait till you hear this.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:33:43
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:33:46
So Andy's like, okay, you know, you guys don't like the company, right? Type of thing, and said, you know, but didn't really threaten us, which was kind of nice.

[Ink] 23:33:53
But said that she has a mission for us, because, you know, Phoenix tattled on us.

[Ink] 23:33:57
And said she wants us to take a suitcase. Back to, um… the company ship, and lure a CEO or some big executive onto the ship.

[Ink] 23:34:09
Um, that's in our, like, area of the company. And then leave, and the suitcase will blow up.

[Ink] 23:34:16
Um. Uh, it looked like, yeah, something will happen that's probably not great for the company.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:17
She didn't say that, it's heavily implied. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:34:22
Um, but yeah, we talked about incinerating our garbage, I guess is what the, uh… So, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:25
We did, yeah.

[Ink] 23:34:28
Some of that effect. Um, original offer was 2 million credits, but Murderbot also is awesome at negotiation.

[Ink] 23:34:36
Um, and so managed just 1 million credits apiece. Um, plus up front, we get 100,000 credits towards any CyberMods that we want.

[Ink] 23:34:47
So right now, we have 100,000 credits of CyberMods, plus you got the 102 that you just got in your bank account, whatever else you had.

[Ink] 23:34:53
That you can spend on cyber mods, but if you just want to spend the $100 up front, I don't think we get, like, the credit beyond the 100, so you probably want to spend the entire $100.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:34:53
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:35:00
Um, and beyond. So Murderbot went first, and spent, like, 120,000 credits.

[Ink] 23:35:05
But it turns out that Murderbot had already been modded. Um, so Murderbot overclocked himself, kind of like Johnny Mnemonic.

[Ink] 23:35:12
And… It's all messed up.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:14
Murderbot did not know this, obviously, he wouldn't do this to himself had he known.

[Ink] 23:35:17
Yeah, Murderbot had a holo pet, and so we probably, you know, it's probably been the… suspect when murder bot was petting something in the middle of nowhere, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:35:26
And you think to go look at Device Manager and see what was plugged into you or something?

[Ink] 23:35:28
That's right.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:32
Stupid. Wait, GM, I didn't know this, right? Or did I know this? Or is it on a subroutine that I knew? Oh my god.

[GM] 23:35:39
I think… I think it's pretty obvious that you didn't know it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:42
Okay, all right.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:44
I think… whatever the…

[Dex Miro] 23:35:49
Panic button thing is, like, is exactly the sort of thing the company would install in you and not tell you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:54
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:35:56
Yeah, that sounds right.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:09
So, we're looking at the… the spreadsheet pattern?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:36:14
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:14
And we're looking to do any mods. I mean, you all should… make sure you don't have any hidden mods on your bodies, either.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:36:21
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:36:24
Has anybody seen the, uh, the TV show Westworld? Right, you know, like, when the Asian guy finds out that the girl doesn't know she's a bot, and then thinks he's a robot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:26
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:36:27
All right.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:27
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:36:35
Like, that's what… Ig's having one of those moments, right?

[Dex Miro] 23:36:38
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:43
So, you get number of slots. For the modifications.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:49
Um… did we go over that with you? Oh.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:53
We didn't know.

[Ink] 23:36:55
Do you see the spreadsheet, Carnoc?

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:57
Oh, it's in the spreadsheet?

[Dex Miro] 23:37:00
I mean, it doesn't say that part where you're… You can get one slickware for every 10 intelligence, and one cyberware slot for every 10 strengths.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:37:11
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:15
So, is Murderbot dead? GM?

[GM] 23:37:19
Guess we'll have to wait to find out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:21
Oh, damn it! I did! I did, with advantage, I succeeded! Yeah, what would have happened if I failed? I would… I would have been replaced.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:22
Didn't you succeed on your roller pad? Can you imagine what would happen if you failed?

[Ink] 23:37:30
Well, the download would have failed, and he would have been fine.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:31
They would have… they would have sent us… They would… they would have sent us another… they would have sent us Murderbot version 3.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:37:32
Hey, our trailer would have been stalled. About their tools.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:42
I'm assuming there's quite a bit to do with people picking their slickware and cyberware and rolling for it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:51
Oh, probably. Well, yeah, depending on if I'm dead or not.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:41:15
I don't know what I want now, I don't like anything.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:21
If you don't like any of it? Well, you don't like any of it that you can afford.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:41:22
Not really. Right, I like things I can't afford.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:28
Well, just think of the mission and go with that. See what would help the most.

[Ink] 23:41:36
I liked your choices, I just probably picked something other than piloting, I guess would be the addition.

[Ink] 23:41:40
I think he did well, Murderbot.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:43
Well, you know, it's not gonna matter. I think I'm dead.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:41:56
Everyone gets disadvantaged on Wednesday.

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:57
I didn't fucking know I had shit in me already. I was like, ooh, this sounds great, alright, let's get it done!

[Dex Miro] 23:42:01
GM's gonna sneakily TPK us by dangling rewards in front of us here.

[GM] 23:42:05
Mm-hmm.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:08
And I think they… I think the company covered it enough where I couldn't be like, run diagnostics report, or something like that, and the shit would have… popped up left and right.

[Ink] 23:42:59
Can we hear the song?

[Murderbot V2] 23:43:04
What is this?

[Dex Miro] 23:43:05
What?

[GM] 23:43:06
I heard it briefly.

[Ink] 23:43:09
Well, let me… how do I download it so I can send it to you?

[Ink] 23:43:15
Oh, shoot, here we go.

[Ink] 23:43:22
I hope those will be worth it. Oops, that's the wrong one.

[Ink] 23:43:31
Oh, it's still generating. You know, I'll play through my… hopefully it gets tier through here.

[Ink] 23:43:37
It's all safe.

[Ink] 23:43:42
It's the guts of the dream with Christ and care! The people lost.

[Ink] 23:43:52
Thanks to the guts on the train when it quits and chair!

[Ink] 23:44:14
Just a man's names.

[GM] 23:44:17
Okay, I'll… I couldn't really put it together, but I know it's an anthem to Zeke, is what I…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:18
I kind of like…

[Murderbot V2] 23:44:21
Dude, that's… Fucking scary.

[Ink] 23:44:25
Yeah. Uh, so yeah, here, I won't sing it, but, you know, the… what is it, what do they say?

[Dex Miro] 23:44:25
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:27
Oh, I want to hear more of it, I couldn't hear it.

[Ink] 23:44:33
The company said, let the poor folk choke, our lungs went raw, we coughed and joked.

[Ink] 23:44:37
But one brave hand with a wrench so keen breathed life once more into Prosper's dream.

[Ink] 23:44:43
He's the man they call Zeke. He gave us back our air, fixed the guts of the dream with grit and care.

[Ink] 23:44:49
From the depths of DOPTown, the people all speak, we're alive today because the man's named Zeke, because the man's named Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:57
Oh, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:02
It's fucking terrifying that… it was able to come up with that, with a melody.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:45:02
Whatever versions.

[Ink] 23:45:12
And I got 4 different versions I can potentially choose from, too, of the… It's all the same lyrics, but I told you it's a tavern… a tavern shanty.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:12
And lyrics, no less. Oh. My. God!

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:18
Dude, that's… Terrifying.

[GM] 23:45:22
Definitely shanty.

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:25
Songwriters should be shitting in their pants right now, man. That's crazy!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:45:28
Oh, they are, right? That's a thing.

[Ink] 23:45:34
Now, every solo station in…

[Dex Miro] 23:45:35
Really quick questions, GM. The… So this, the query came from…

[GM] 23:45:36
Yep.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:40
The icebox or the other way around.

[GM] 23:45:42
The icebox is where you install the slickware, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:45
And then cyber orders the chop shot. And then… who's Babushka?

[GM] 23:45:49
Yep. She runs the chop shop.

[Dex Miro] 23:45:55
Okay. And we don't have a picture of her, do we?

[Murderbot V2] 23:45:58
I mean, I will say…

[GM] 23:46:02
I do not have a picture of her.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:07
But we kind of got the, uh… crotchety Grandma vibe, I guess.

[GM] 23:46:13
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:46:15
Ship with that in the AI, give me a crotchety Grandma and Prosper Station.

[GM] 23:46:20
With a… with a cane that looks like a gun… like a shotgun.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:24
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:46:31
Any mods? Yeah.

[GM] 23:46:33
Does she have any mods? Um…

[GM] 23:46:42
Unknown. Assume everything.

[Ink] 23:50:32
I don't like the first pass at Babushka. Yeah, work on my prompt.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:40
It's not doing a good job on Babushka.

[Ink] 23:50:42
Uh, I blame my prompt more than anything, probably. I'll let you look at what they… what I came up with, but I'm trying to prompt again.

[Ink] 23:50:48
Oh, actually, first, uh, you need this. This picture, which probably could use somewhere too, but still is pretty funny.

[GM] 23:50:59
It's still… Still, yeah, still the snake eyes that aren't Snake Eyes.

[Dex Miro] 23:51:00
Shake eyes. And there's 95% of them. I love that it's shake eyes, not snake eyes, though.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:51:04
Oh…

[Ink] 23:51:11
So I gave another prompt, we'll see if it does any better this second.

[GM] 23:51:18
I think I like the… the second one better.

[Dex Miro] 23:51:27
Yeah, I don't think it understands the concept of the shotgun cane very well.

[Ink] 23:51:31
No, that's a part of the prompt that I'm, uh… taking the most blame for there.

[GM] 23:51:31
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:51:36
And then… I think that she's slightly older than I was expecting, too, but I put grandma in there, so that's… that's probably… that's one of the things my fault.

[GM] 23:59:49
Getting a little too happy in this, uh, this here mothership.

[GM] 23:59:54
Gonna have to take it down a notch. Make it more scary.

[Ink] 23:59:59
Tried to get us to go down the… to the choke.

[GM] 00:00:02
Yeah. Dude… You said you wanted to go. You were like, yeah, let's go that way.

[Ink] 00:00:07
I was tempted. I was like, if I could, like, re-sleeve and send my clone down there, I would.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:12
Just in case it is real bad.

[Ink] 00:00:14
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:17
I don't know, when the… people that are just barely staying alive because there's not enough oxygen are telling you it's too scary to go there, maybe it's not the greatest idea.

[Ink] 00:00:27
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:37
I don't know, I still feel like there's something fishy about this whole deal.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:42
So she's just offering us too much money.

[Ink] 00:00:50
Jesus is gonna blow us all up? As soon as we put our, our, uh… Well, I mean, right, she could execute us anytime, right? There's no reason she could… if she wanted us, dead.

[Ink] 00:01:02
Um, but the worst is we deliver it, and she just blows us up anyway.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:06
Right, but then she doesn't actually have to pay us the 5 million.

[Ink] 00:01:09
Yeah. But if we… if we go there, we deliver, it blows up, and we come back.

[Ink] 00:01:15
Um, then she knows we're loyal. And she's got something on us, and…

[Dex Miro] 00:01:18
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:01:21
Were pretty valuable, I guess, at that point. I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:25
Maybe she just makes so much money off this Sycorax thing that she doesn't really have to care.

[Ink] 00:01:30
Yeah.

[GM] 00:01:31
I say, you're so, so used to being exploited, Dex, that you don't realize that maybe… maybe you could just make more money.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:34
Yeah. Yeah.

[GM] 00:01:38
Maybe this is what everybody else in the entire galaxy gets paid, and just because you work for the company, you get paid.

[GM] 00:01:44
Shit. Everyone out there is a millionaire except for you guys. You poor suckers that have just been working for the company that make no money.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:54
Apparently, I mean, people all over the station have all this stuff, and some of it's real expensive, so…

[GM] 00:02:00
Yeah.

[GM] 00:02:19
So, I'm curious… about, um…

[GM] 00:02:25
These… seeing all this… all these modifications and stuff. Uh, and similarly, like, with, like, items and things.

[GM] 00:02:32
Um, how much of a motivator to, like, acquire more wealth.

[GM] 00:02:38
Does this actually add an element to, like, oh… Here's the thing I could actually do with money, so here's a… potentially a drive for my character to want to go and get money.

[GM] 00:02:47
Or is it kind of just… Uh…

[GM] 00:02:53
A perk that isn't really motivating, that, like. The other elements of the game, like… character development, or narrative, or whatever are far more motivating.

[Ink] 00:03:04
I don't feel as motivated to update my character as I did in D&D.

[GM] 00:03:10
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 00:03:10
If that… um… I definitely feel, I guess, very discouraged from rolling in this game at all.

[GM] 00:03:20
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:03:23
And so it's… it's the weird thing of we kind of… Well, and you don't necessarily fail, right? We still sometimes shoot the target, but something bad happens if you rolled under, which is…

[Ink] 00:03:33
Which is a little bit different than DID, where, like, it's a complete miss.

[GM] 00:03:36
Right, right.

[Ink] 00:03:38
Um, but…

[Dex Miro] 00:03:39
I think that's one of the reasons anything that gives you a… there's not very many things that give you advantage, but that's what makes those very interesting.

[GM] 00:03:47
Right, right. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:50
But ironically, those are some of the cheaper stuff.

[GM] 00:03:55
Yeah, I'm asking this because Mothership doesn't have, like, a lot of leveling up. It's like… you'll… you'll do rest and recovery at the end of a mission.

[Dex Miro] 00:04:00
Yeah.

[GM] 00:04:05
You know, spend a few thousand credits. And maybe you'll actually, like, upgrade a save?

[GM] 00:04:12
By a few points. But ultimately, like.

[GM] 00:04:15
You know, you're… strength, intellect, speed, combat are all more or less gonna stay the same.

[GM] 00:04:22
And so, I felt… I think, like… I'm… yeah, that's why I asked the question, because I was just like.

[GM] 00:04:29
Would items like these, these are effectively the equivalent of magic items for… you know, the setting. It's like, are these motivating? Because, like.

[GM] 00:04:37
Here's a list of all the things you could acquire.

[GM] 00:04:45
Yeah, I don't know. Wow, now you're asking the big questions.

[Ink] 00:04:46
How much is a new ship cost?

[Dex Miro] 00:04:47
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:04:51
Well, did somebody… he took a shot at our ship, you know, the… Really good.

[GM] 00:04:52
Um…

[Dex Miro] 00:04:55
So why can't we, like, steal this one? Little strip we already have.

[GM] 00:04:58
Still, what?

[Ink] 00:05:02
Yeah, but she said it's junk. I mean, we are gonna have this shit.

[Dex Miro] 00:05:05
This is true. Oh, you want a nice ship.

[Ink] 00:05:06
Right?

[GM] 00:05:07
You… so I had to… Yeah. The, um…

[GM] 00:05:13
I could probably give you guys the ship manual, um… Because there's nothing in there that, uh…

[GM] 00:05:21
Actually… Is it, like… breaks any kind of narrative or anything. However, I had to rework the, uh…

[GM] 00:05:29
The economics of it, because it made absolutely no fucking sense.

[GM] 00:05:33
It's like, as well-designed as Mothership is, as just a game system, and like… theme and everything fits together real nice, everything's compact.

[GM] 00:05:44
The economy of ships makes absolutely no fucking sense. I spent.

[GM] 00:05:50
Literally, like, hours, poring over trying to do the math to figure out, like, how they were coming up with the numbers for the ships that they were.

[GM] 00:05:56
Proposing, and I was like… Alright, in this chart, you say it's this price, and then if I add up all those things over here.

[GM] 00:06:04
Then I come up with a very different price. And so then maybe some of these things scale with the size of the ship?

[GM] 00:06:10
But then I tried, like, adding in, like… just, like, different… Like, so many different, uh… algorithms for calculating the, uh…

[GM] 00:06:21
The price of the ship.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:21
I mean, is that just the whole thing, where if you were to… by all the parts of a car and put it together yourself, it would cost you 5 times as much.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:28
That kind of thing, or…

[GM] 00:06:29
Well, but there's a hidden cost, it's like, but, you know, yes, it might cost me 5 times as much, but we don't know how much I get paid.

[GM] 00:06:36
And so we don't actually know the end value of the car, because we have no idea how much air got paid for it.

[GM] 00:06:42
So there's just always, like, a missing factor in… Uh, and that.

[GM] 00:06:47
Let me see… so I could… Let's see, I'll download the ship manual.

[GM] 00:06:54
And I can post that. So you can see the different types of ships in the ship upgrades and stuff, and I think I can…

[GM] 00:07:02
Find where I put…

[GM] 00:07:09
Mothership… Ship Breakers Toolkit.

[GM] 00:07:15
Download.

[GM] 00:07:25
And…

[GM] 00:07:29
Can I reply to Dex's… Can I… actually, I'll probably just go to the…

[GM] 00:07:35
This one.

[GM] 00:08:05
Okay. You should have received… an email with the Ship Breakers toolkit in it.

[GM] 00:08:11
So you can look at all the cool ships. And so, if you spend any time with that, your ship that you have is a…

[GM] 00:08:21
Um, freighter… Class 2 freighter, I think.

[GM] 00:08:48
Yeah. Class 2 freighter.

[Ink] 00:09:14
Trying to have it make elevator music for the, uh, turbo lifts, but it…

[GM] 00:09:18
Nope, nope, that's mine.

[Ink] 00:09:21
I'm not sure if I like it or not.

[Ink] 00:09:30
Oh, these pages are supposed to be, like, next to each other, I see.

[GM] 00:09:45
In the PDF?

[Ink] 00:09:46
Yeah, there's, like, a thing that looked like he got chopped off, and I was like, what was wrong with this? And I was like, oh, it's on the next page. It's like, go… beside each other. My PDF here is just not doing that.

[Ink] 00:09:59
There we go, two-page for you. Yay! It's, of course, put the wrong… the page is the wrong pages next to each other, that's a bummer.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:06
There should be a setting for that, too. Like most of the viewers have, like, a setting for whether.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:11
Even pages are on the left, or our pages are on the left, or something.

[Ink] 00:10:13
Gotcha. I'm just using Chrome's built-in ones, I need to do something better.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:18
I had to deal with all these headaches when I had scanned all my piano sheet music.

[Ink] 00:10:22
Oh, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:23
Like, I wish there was a way, like, in the PDF file to specify how this should be lined up.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:29
Most things tend to assume that there's gonna be, like, a front cover page, and then… The next one is the inside, and after that, they should be facing.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:38
But…

[Ink] 00:10:39
Huh, so they have one page, and then the next two will be together. That's interesting.

[Ink] 00:10:44
I guess I kind of makes sense, but yeah, you would want to have to build.

[Dex Miro] 00:10:44
Yeah. But I guess that's not what happened when I opened this one, so…

[Ink] 00:10:55
Oh, huh. It, uh… it did a great job in preview, like, it…

[Ink] 00:11:01
I don't know how it's knowing this. There must be some setting, because… the pay… the first page is by itself, the second page is, um…

[Ink] 00:11:09
Then it starts to… okay, no, it's a distant thing. The first page, assumed the first page was a cover.

[Ink] 00:11:14
Which brought this together just fine for me now. In preview.

[Ink] 00:11:19
On a Mac, at least.

[Dex Miro] 00:11:25
So, did you buy the physical version of all these books, GM, or just the PDFs?

[GM] 00:11:29
I have the physical version of all these books, except for… Um, technically, the module we're running out of right now, which is called Pound of Flush.

[GM] 00:11:38
Is, um… my friend's book, but I have the physical version in front of me.

[GM] 00:11:45
And then, um… Another module that, if we want to continue to play.

[GM] 00:11:53
Um, it'll be… it's called gradient descent. I also have the physical version, and that's also his.

[GM] 00:11:58
His book. But… I have the… players… ship… Ship Breakers Toolkit, Players Survival Guide, um…

[GM] 00:12:08
Another bug hunt… And the Warden's operating manual.

[GM] 00:12:16
And now I cannot find, for the life of me, where I put my notes for fixing the goddamn prices of these ships.

[GM] 00:12:24
To write right in here? Did I just correct them all right in the… I'm the same.

[GM] 00:12:30
Oh, yep, I did. Okay, all my notes are inside the physical book.

[Ink] 00:12:31
Refuel.

[Ink] 00:12:38
Oh, wow, we're gonna start paying for fuel.

[GM] 00:12:42
Or jumping around? Hell yeah, I gotta pay for those jumps.

[Dex Miro] 00:12:52
The company doesn't pay, though.

[Ink] 00:12:55
Well, we're not gonna be part of the company, we're gonna blow it up, man.

[GM] 00:12:57
Then you're gonna have to… Then you're gonna have to start paying.

[Dex Miro] 00:12:57
Well, right now, do they pay even?

[Ink] 00:13:07
You had to pay one… 1,000… credits for your, uh, carry-on luggage.

[GM] 00:13:17
Yeah.

[GM] 00:13:23
So yeah, your ship's kind of junky.

[Ink] 00:13:29
Everybody keeps saying.

[GM] 00:13:32
It's not the worship in the entire galaxy, but it's… it's kind of junky.

[Dex Miro] 00:13:48
So what'd you say we were greater?

[Ink] 00:13:51
Bigger plus 2.

[Ink] 00:13:57
They're a Class 2 free.

[GM] 00:14:03
Yeah, so on page 28 of the Ship Breaker's manual, you see the… You'll see that all the, like, upgrades and things, um…

[GM] 00:14:13
And I've made significant notes. In here, about how to change things.

[GM] 00:14:19
But… that's for another day, I'm not gonna get into that tonight, because I gotta go to bed.

[Ink] 00:14:26
Thank you.

[Dex Miro] 00:14:26
Rail gun, 6 million credits.

[GM] 00:14:27
Yep. Get yourself a rail gun.

[Ink] 00:14:40
So, is there… am I missing the price of, like, a complete ship, or is that… I'm gonna have to add all these things. Those are minor upgrades, major upgrades.

[Ink] 00:14:51
Oh, there you go, the boarding sift coffin. Oh, no, those are drop ships, okay, that's… we have a drop ship, right?

[GM] 00:14:55
Yep. And…

[Ink] 00:14:57
50 million credits.

[GM] 00:15:01
And also, in addition to that drop ship. You have, uh…

[GM] 00:15:06
The, whatchamacallit, the APC on it.

[Dex Miro] 00:15:13
That's not, like, ours, is it?

[GM] 00:15:16
Oh, it's all the companies.

[Dex Miro] 00:15:18
Right.

[Ink] 00:15:21
What's APC stand for? Oh, gotcha.

[GM] 00:15:23
Armored personnel carrier.

[Ink] 00:15:32
Was that something we picked up in the last mission? Because we were walking it when we landed for our drop ship before, right?

[GM] 00:15:40
Um, yeah, you picked up the APC from, uh, Greta Base.

[GM] 00:15:45
And so, presumably, you drove that onto the… drop ship, and then flew off with that.

[Ink] 00:15:49
The drug.

[Dex Miro] 00:15:52
So much easier to do after all the carts were gone.

[GM] 00:15:56
Yeah. So the… the freighter…

[GM] 00:16:01
Class 2, uh… It says in little tiny print, uh, underneath, it says, cost $250 million.

[Dex Miro] 00:16:10
That does, okay. Yeah, I missed that, because it was in the light gray, but…

[GM] 00:16:12
Yeah, it's pretty hard to… Let's see.

[Dex Miro] 00:16:17
That's expensive. Okay. So I guess…

[Dex Miro] 00:16:24
Maybe 5 million credits is not really a lot.

[Ink] 00:16:34
Oh, and that's… that's a good point, right? Because if… If she's offering us something, like, crazy expensive, then we might just realize that, like, we're going on a suicide mission for her.

[Dex Miro] 00:16:47
Like… How much do you think a beer costs, GM?

[GM] 00:16:52
A beer? I have prices for that. Yeah, at the…

[Dex Miro] 00:16:53
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:16:56
You have price for beer?

[GM] 00:17:00
Stellar Burn. Price of… Beer, can or bottle, 5 credits.

[Ink] 00:17:08
Okay. So, a ship would be like a ship in the ocean, right? Type of… Money-wise?

[Dex Miro] 00:17:14
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. So, like, generally, individuals don't own chips.

[GM] 00:17:21
Right. I think, actually, that's one of the things it says early on in the…

[GM] 00:17:28
Ship Breakers Toolkit is, like… you know, this is… Or maybe it doesn't say it anywhere in here, maybe that's in the, uh…

[GM] 00:17:35
Warden's Manual, but they're basically, like. Don't give your players a ship at the beginning. That's too much.

[GM] 00:17:41
Have them, like, be indentured servants to their ship. Like… like, they're… maybe they're leasing it, and so, like, they'll… they'll go bankrupt if something happens to it, or, you know.

[GM] 00:17:53
Just make sure that the ship is not seen as, like, this is our ship!

[Ink] 00:18:00
So drop ship is worth $50 million.

[Dex Miro] 00:18:05
Yeah, to sell it, we'd have to steal it first.

[Ink] 00:18:09
But we already have it, right? I mean…

[Ink] 00:18:15
I see, I see. We show back up, and like. Yeah, we had to pawn our drop ship off to get this thing, you know, like, you owe us some more, you know, get us new dropshipping.

[Ink] 00:18:24
Before we blow you frick up!

[Ink] 00:18:31
You're in on the credits, we need some more to complete this mission.

[GM] 00:18:39
Alright, I gotta log off. Have a good night, guys.
