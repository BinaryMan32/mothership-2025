[Dex Miro] 21:33:30
I feel like there's some foreshadowing going on there, but…

[GM] 21:33:31
Um…

[Ink] 21:33:33
My witchfinger?

[GM] 21:33:36
Well, you choose. You probably want to choose one that's least useful, so in case you do end up losing a finger, it's…

[Dex Miro] 21:33:43
I mean, does it let you pick more than one for redundancy, like your phone?

[GM] 21:33:48
Are the fingerprints in your left hand and your right hand the same?

[Ink] 21:33:51
No, they're very energies of each other. I said they're mirror images of each other.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:51
I don't think so.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:33:54
People who want this?

[GM] 21:33:54
What's that? Are they? Okay, okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:33:58
That doesn't sound right.

[GM] 21:34:00
I don't fucking know.

[Murderbot V2] 21:34:05
You know, it just… you sound confident enough, and people will just believe it.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:09
I guess, oh yeah.

[GM] 21:34:09
Ink, you're a smart guy. I believe things you say.

[Ink] 21:34:14
Honestly, GM.

[GM] 21:34:18
All right, um… Yeah, so the main mission here is you're to find how the drugs, um, Sycorax, is being produced on Prospero's Dream.

[GM] 21:34:29
And to… I believe you're supposed to eliminate… the people who are making them?

[GM] 21:34:37
Is that right?

[Ink] 21:34:38
I think that was, uh… the side objective, right? At least get some… We could take them out, that was good.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:34:40
Hold on one second, I'll find it.

[GM] 21:34:45
Oh, yeah, yeah. You at least have to figure out who they are.

[Dex Miro] 21:34:49
Yeah, it wasn't clear whether we have to actually kill them ourselves, or just make some arrangements so that the company can get people on to get rid of them.

[GM] 21:34:55
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:34:56
I think there was a bonus in it. We wouldn't be as far in depth if we came back with somebody's head.

[GM] 21:35:00
Yeah. Um… And Zeke's character, Zeke, was able to negotiate paying off.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:01
Okay.

[GM] 21:35:07
Most of his debt for having his cognitive defragmentation.

[Dex Miro] 21:35:11
Well, stupid or impressive negotiation. I thought that was going to be very expensive.

[GM] 21:35:16
Uh, it… I mean, it is. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:35:17
I'm very, very valuable on this mission, okay? They needed me.

[Ink] 21:35:18
Actually sensitive.

[GM] 21:35:23
He is the one scientist on your team.

[GM] 21:35:28
Um… after you'd landed, um… you had to go through, uh, decontamination.

[GM] 21:35:34
Um, but, you know… you're giving back all your gear and stuff, and I think we stopped basically just as the doors to the…

[GM] 21:35:42
Main station we're opening. And, uh…

[GM] 21:35:47
That's where we'll pick up. So the doors open in the station, and sort of the first thing that you immediately notice is that many people are augmented.

[GM] 21:35:56
Walking around, you see people with cybernetic arms. They've got laser eyes, all kinds of augmentation.

[GM] 21:36:11
You have more difficulty finding someone who doesn't look augmented in some way than a person who is.

[GM] 21:36:20
You guys should be on the screen where you can see, like, a sort of a side view of the station, and then, like, a top-down view.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:27
Yeah, yep.

[GM] 21:36:27
Is that right? Okay. Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:36:33
By the way, GM, when I was, uh… I went and searched on Google for the… that, like, ambience clip you linked us to before, because I forgot to save that.

[Dex Miro] 21:36:42
And one of the things I ran across was, like, somebody that.

[GM] 21:36:42
Oh, the soundtrack?

[Dex Miro] 21:36:46
Made a form that they showed to their… like, the people in their group when they came on the station, and they had to actually fill it out. I just thought that was funny.

[GM] 21:36:57
There's a… there's a whole module itself, which is just, like.

[GM] 21:37:01
Uh, contracts that you give to your players. Like, and they're, like, they're, like, brutal contracts. They're like, you know, like, we own this of you, we own that of you, and like…

[Dex Miro] 21:37:03
Yeah. Oh, that makes sense.

[Dex Miro] 21:37:12
Yeah, that very much goes along with the whole vibe of the company, I love that.

[GM] 21:37:15
Yeah. So, um…

[GM] 21:37:22
Entering the station, uh, you can easily find, like, a map that kind of directs you to certain locations.

[GM] 21:37:29
You can find pretty much anything. Um, the error seems relatively clean, although there's a slight, sort of, um…

[GM] 21:37:39
Uh, where are you at? You're at… location…

[GM] 21:37:48
Um… one? You got one?

[GM] 21:37:52
Yes, you're at 1. Um, which is… not, like, um…

[GM] 21:38:00
I guess the aroma in the air is, like. Maybe, like…

[GM] 21:38:05
A little bit, like, sweat. Mixed with, like, alcohol.

[GM] 21:38:11
Um… almost like you… like, you… get almost a feeling like there's a party going on nearby.

[GM] 21:38:20
People are coming and going in and out of the… they are locked to the dry dock.

[GM] 21:38:27
Um… And no one's really, like, paying you any mind.

[GM] 21:38:33
Uh… I think… what was his name? That we had.

[GM] 21:38:38
Um… Phoenix done right.

[Ink] 21:38:41
Or…

[GM] 21:38:44
Says, well, guys… We got here. I think I'm gonna take off and find… find my family.

[Ink] 21:38:51
Oh, he's got, like, kids and stuff? Yeah, we're supposed to, like, off him.

[GM] 21:38:53
Yeah, of course I got kids.

[GM] 21:38:59
Do say that to him?

[Ink] 21:39:01
No! Hey, uh, Phoenix, uh, where can we find you?

[GM] 21:39:06
Uh, well, you know, I'm hoping that my… my kids haven't been put in the choke.

[GM] 21:39:11
You know, I only left them with so many credits, so hopefully they didn't breathe too hard.

[GM] 21:39:17
Otherwise, they'd be down in the choke. Uh, so, if not there, then you can find me, uh, near.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:39:18
Too good.

[GM] 21:39:27
Um… the farm, which is…

[GM] 21:39:33
Number 5 on the map.

[Dex Miro] 21:39:35
Wait, they charge babies full price?

[Ink] 21:39:36
We'll just… just by your relation, right? I mean, hopefully they're, uh, taking less auctions to, like, cost less, right?

[GM] 21:39:38
Heck yeah, man. It's brutal here.

[GM] 21:39:45
Yeah. But, you know… It's a relatively fair price, you know. People who work.

[GM] 21:39:53
You know, like in the Teamsters Union. This is, uh… you know, if you're willing to work, you can pay your way.

[GM] 21:40:01
That's what I like about this place. It's, you know, it's about freedom.

[GM] 21:40:04
We're all free here. We don't have to… They're not subject to the damn company's, uh, whims.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:40:10
Yeah, damn company.

[GM] 21:40:15
Thanks, guys, it was a good journey, good few months with you.

[GM] 21:40:20
I'll catch you guys later. Starts… starts walking off.

[Ink] 21:40:27
Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:40:30
So he just knew how to get us to Prospero, right? He didn't… he doesn't know anything about the drug.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:40:36
Okay.

[Ink] 21:40:37
Well, can I… I want to tail him. Out of his, uh, view.

[GM] 21:40:41
Yeah, first to answer Carnoc's question. So… You know that his… he was a part of a…

[GM] 21:40:49
Teamsters Union, uh, was… caught with the drug on board their ship.

[GM] 21:40:54
They deny any kind of, um… Like… knowing about it slash, you know, their…

[GM] 21:41:03
They're not the ones that are distributing it, like… But the company's assertion is that.

[GM] 21:41:08
They're part of your… they're essentially drug mules that they've been transporting this drug around.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:41:13
Okay.

[GM] 21:41:13
So, um… No. Whether or not he knows where…

[GM] 21:41:20
He never shared that he knew where the, uh, drug was coming from.

[GM] 21:41:24
And you… you figure probably, likely, he… you know, just boards the ship and takes it wherever it needs to go, and, you know, doesn't ask too many questions.

[GM] 21:41:34
Kind of thing.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:41:38
In Dex's log, I asked him a question, what is he gonna do after the mission? And he apparently responded, he's just gonna go back to running cigarettes.

[GM] 21:41:48
Yeah, I mean, that seems likely. He's gotta work, you know?

[Ink] 21:41:52
Yeah, it does. He's the only one they can out us, so we gotta… we gotta watch him.

[GM] 21:41:53
Um, alright, Ink's gonna tail him.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:42:00
Yeah.

[GM] 21:42:01
Okay. Um… You tail him for…

[GM] 21:42:11
About 3 hours. Um, like…

[GM] 21:42:17
Takes you about 3 hours to, like, get around to 5.

[GM] 21:42:20
Um, you pass by… Or… which is…

[Ink] 21:42:25
We think tied at the farm, you said?

[GM] 21:42:27
Yeah, he's… he's by the farm. Passed by 4, and 4 is, uh…

[GM] 21:42:33
You see this place called the Icebox? Um…

[GM] 21:42:39
And it, uh, says that it… sort of the advertisement on the outside is.

[GM] 21:42:45
Need a new body? Get re-sleeved.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:42:49
We sleep.

[GM] 21:42:50
Um… Uh, and then… then it's also, like.

[GM] 21:42:54
And if not, enjoy our slickware. Um, slickware is…

[GM] 21:43:00
Essentially, um, when you have augmentations, and specifically, like. Um… forget which one it is, but…

[GM] 21:43:07
You can download, um… data into it. And so it's, like, more of the…

[GM] 21:43:15
Uh, operating systems than it is the, uh, physical. Components. Like the… physical modifications.

[GM] 21:43:23
Um, and then you walk by 2. Which is…

[GM] 21:43:29
Uh, there's a… number of bars in this area, but the most prominent sign and display is a place called the Stellar Burn.

[GM] 21:43:40
A lot of people coming in and out of that place.

[Dex Miro] 21:43:44
Color burn.

[GM] 21:43:44
Um… Stellar Burn.

[GM] 21:43:49
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 21:43:53
GM, can Androids get… Modifications, too?

[GM] 21:43:58
Sure.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:00
Okay. Oh, wait!

[Ink] 21:44:01
You might not want to out yourself, dude. They don't like droids.

[GM] 21:44:05
They don't like company droids. Yeah. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:05
Oh, that's right. Oh, wonderful. And I'm guessing all my inside parts have all the company…

[Ink] 21:44:08
That's something you would rather, yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:44:16
They're not labeled.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:16
Label all over it.

[GM] 21:44:17
Yeah, probably.

[Ink] 21:44:18
You're like an iPhone. They can, you know, be replaced with parts that, uh, Apple, you know, certifies, right?

[Dex Miro] 21:44:19
Great.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:23
Approves.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:24
Right, are you just… are you just livestreaming us to the company, like, 24-7?

[Ink] 21:44:29
That's right.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:30
Are you asking me… In character?

[Dex Miro] 21:44:33
I'm asking you, but I'm also knowing you're not going to answer, honestly.

[Ink] 21:44:37
He's just watching company Netflix constantly, that's what that's all.

[Dex Miro] 21:44:41
Uh, the actual Murderbot. Still need to watch that.

[GM] 21:44:42
Yeah, he's gotta get his… his fix. Um.

[Murderbot V2] 21:44:49
Stupid humans.

[GM] 21:44:50
You're… as you're walking by, uh, the Stellar Burn, um. The lights flicker.

[GM] 21:44:55
Uh, and they go out for a second, and it kind of goes silent, and you hear, um… the sound of, like, a heartbeat.

[GM] 21:45:03
And, like, heavy, belabored… Breathing. And it's like… Not just…

[GM] 21:45:11
Like, nearby you, it seems like it's all around. And the lights come back on, and you hear, like, cheers coming out of, like, Stellar Burn. It's like, yeah!

[Ink] 21:45:25
You said breathing all around us.

[GM] 21:45:28
Uh, sound of heartbeat, and then belabored breathing. Yeah.

[Ink] 21:45:32
All around us, huh?

[Murderbot V2] 21:45:37
What?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:45:39
Hmm…

[Ink] 21:45:42
And we didn't feel anything, we just heard kind of…

[GM] 21:45:44
Just… you just heard it. You didn't… no… no changes in…

[GM] 21:45:50
Smell… You didn't feel anything in your skin.

[GM] 21:45:54
Just heard it.

[GM] 21:46:00
Oh, no. Phoenix Dunright's getting away, gotta follow him. Keep moving.

[Ink] 21:46:05
Really?

[GM] 21:46:07
Uh, you… You did not disappear when the lights were on.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:07
It didn't disappear when the lights were out?

[GM] 21:46:12
Um, if anything, he probably just stopped and, like, kind of looked around.

[GM] 21:46:15
I mean, lights routes that you wouldn't have necessarily seen that.

[GM] 21:46:19
Um, but yeah, he seemed sort of astonished. Um, but didn't think much of it.

[Dex Miro] 21:46:19
Maybe somebody was going to revoke his access or something.

[GM] 21:46:25
You get to 5… Which is near the farm.

[GM] 21:46:29
Uh, you see them go up to, like, what looks like a residential… Um, doorway… Uh, like, he punches in a code.

[GM] 21:46:38
And the door opens, and he, like, visibly sighs. He was… he apparently was not expecting, necessarily, for that to be the case.

[Ink] 21:46:52
Well, why do you need the door to open?

[GM] 21:46:58
Uh… It seemed like he was relieved that the door did open.

[Ink] 21:47:02
Oh, gotcha, that's good. I see, okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:10
It seems like it's gonna be hard for you to follow him in there.

[Ink] 21:47:14
Did I catch the code, or did Murderbot catch it for me?

[Dex Miro] 21:47:22
Wait, we've all been following him, trying to stay… Like, it was… that would… that would be hard.

[Murderbot V2] 21:47:22
Now… Yeah, I thought it was just you.

[Ink] 21:47:27
I guess it's just me, I'm wandering off by myself to this.

[GM] 21:47:29
What kind of cool tools did you buy yourself with the company's money?

[Ink] 21:47:32
Where did I buy myself with the company's money?

[GM] 21:47:34
Do you have, like, a little heat signature pad that you could, like.

[GM] 21:47:38
Shine on the keypad and see where his fingers pressed.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:41
Do you have the list of items we can buy again? We're… I didn't buy anything.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:46
I'm into this, but I didn't actually put it in my inventory, so I'll do that now.

[GM] 21:47:48
Well, Zeke might not get a list, because he might just be… It's so indentured that they're like, eh, maybe not for you.

[Dex Miro] 21:47:53
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:47:55
No items for you.

[GM] 21:47:56
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:47:57
I made a spreadsheet. With the things that I was looking at.

[Ink] 21:48:02
Here's… Here's my… there's a spreadsheet, Zeke.

[GM] 21:48:02
I don't remember how I shared it with you guys.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:07
In the chat. Got it.

[Ink] 21:48:08
Yes. Sorry, it's open document format.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:13
Uh, yeah, let's see, can I read those, maybe?

[GM] 21:48:15
Like, what is the creepy thing behind your head?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:19
A creepy thing behind my head, let me see my logo.

[Ink] 21:48:20
Well, yeah, it's like a head looking at you. Telvin?

[Dex Miro] 21:48:22
The reflection.

[GM] 21:48:22
Yeah, yeah. It's like, you're… you're… you're…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:25
I gotta make myself bigger. Um, let's see, how do I do that?

[GM] 21:48:28
You're setting the tone for mothership quite well.

[Ink] 21:48:31
That's pretty cool.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:31
How do I make myself bigger in the window? Oh, there I am. That… oh, that's, um, that's a reflection.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:32
God, what is that? Is that your face?

[GM] 21:48:34
Watching you, Zeke.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:39
Of my TV. So it's a window. The TV's reflecting off the window. My TV is one of the, uh…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:48:42
The new TV has… a portrait of someone on it.

[Dex Miro] 21:48:44
Your TV has a picture of somebody else. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 21:48:46
Yeah, but that… Oh, so it looks like a… it's a piece of art right now. Oh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:47
Well, it's one of those art TVs. Right, or it displays paintings when it's…

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:48:52
That's a painting, yeah, of someone, I don't know who. An alien.

[GM] 21:48:58
That's not what's-her-face from, uh, System Shock?

[GM] 21:49:06
Um… Okay, so now you know where, uh, what this face lives.

[GM] 21:49:12
Um, if you have a handy doodad, you might be able to figure out, but no, the keypad was… you're keeping enough distance to not, like, see exactly how he punched it in.

[Dex Miro] 21:49:18
Too bad.

[Ink] 21:49:29
I did not think I have anything that would… Let me read his heat signature off there.

[Ink] 21:49:35
That's a bummer. Yeah, they didn't opt for the, uh…

[Ink] 21:49:40
$1,500 infrared goggles.

[Ink] 21:49:46
Okay.

[Ink] 21:49:54
Um, so we started at 1, GM?

[GM] 21:49:57
It started at 1, and you walked around to 5.

[GM] 21:50:06
Now. You were given permission to take… kind of almost as much time as you needed to fulfill this mission.

[GM] 21:50:15
And walking by that stellar burn place. You know, you haven't had, uh, any kind of…

[GM] 21:50:24
What do they call it? Rest?

[GM] 21:50:28
Relaxation. Browsing…

[Dex Miro] 21:50:32
Apparently, we've forgotten how that works, too.

[GM] 21:50:35
Yeah, I gotta pull up my… the thing. Shore leave time.

[Dex Miro] 21:50:40
Oh, yeah, that…

[GM] 21:50:44
How do I take shore leave? You could take shore leave at any relatively safe port.

[GM] 21:50:49
Um… If you've got the cash.

[Dex Miro] 21:50:50
If you got the cash.

[GM] 21:50:57
Jesus, yeah, this is expensive. This is an X-class station.

[Dex Miro] 21:51:03
What does X mean?

[GM] 21:51:05
Um, I think it's, uh, outside of…

[Ink] 21:51:10
One better than W.

[GM] 21:51:12
Outside of, like, normal… Normal jurisdiction.

[GM] 21:51:18
Um… let's see… Sparrow's Dream, it's a massive space station…

[GM] 21:51:26
Is…

[Ink] 21:51:29
This is like indulging our vice.

[GM] 21:51:31
Yeah.

[Ink] 21:51:48
We don't have our hazard suits on, so I have no comms.

[GM] 21:51:52
Well, I mean… You could probably take the comms off your hazard suit and, like, just, like.

[Ink] 21:51:59
Flashback that comes off my hazard suit and made sure…

[GM] 21:52:00
Have them… That's… that's fine.

[GM] 21:52:08
No. Well, I can't find the, uh… I watch them call it, the type of…

[GM] 21:52:15
Station it is, so… we'll just… So it's fine. You could do shore leave.

[Dex Miro] 21:52:23
1d100 times 10 kilo credits. Oh my gosh, that's so much.

[GM] 21:52:27
Yeah, I don't… I think it's X-Class, but I don't actually know. I can't find it, so… I do have specific prices for things, so we'll just go with, like…

[GM] 21:52:39
How much time are we gonna spend?

[Dex Miro] 21:52:42
So X is just supposed to be super, super random, or…?

[GM] 21:52:47
I think it kind of varies, um… So, it says the X-Class ports are notorious criminal settlements and pirate bases.

[GM] 21:52:56
They're beyond the reach of the company, making them much more free and much more dangerous.

[GM] 21:53:00
Hence why I think it's… Probably a next class.

[GM] 21:53:05
Let's just find out. Oof! That'd be a lot.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:05
Yeah, that sounds right.

[GM] 21:53:11
480,000?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:53:12
I don't have that much.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:13
What… what is $480,000? What? What do you mean?

[Dex Miro] 21:53:14
Yeah. Yeah.

[GM] 21:53:15
Your shore leaf?

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:53:17
Doesn't sound right.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:20
Our short leave is $480,000? Credits? That's how much it's gonna cost us for surely?

[Ink] 21:53:24
Credits.

[GM] 21:53:26
Credits. That's what it says.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:53:29
How is that, like, 10 times more than the memory defragmentation?

[Dex Miro] 21:53:29
Yeah.

[GM] 21:53:33
Hmm? Um, but we're not gonna do it that way.

[GM] 21:53:38
That's… that's way too much. You can… you can get drunk.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:39
Yeah, those are crazy.

[GM] 21:53:42
Uh, easily on, like, 100 credits.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:45
Must be nice.

[GM] 21:53:47
It's just a matter of how many days do you need to be drunk for?

[GM] 21:53:50
We'll see you have to be drunk for 48 days. Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:53:53
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:53:53
48 days. But that's cost me another 480 credits.

[Murderbot V2] 21:53:55
Must be nice to be able to get drunk.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:53:56
Surely.

[GM] 21:53:58
Don't you remember how… Dex, was it your character that… that shot the grenade at the Greta base and burned it down?

[Dex Miro] 21:54:03
How it's worked.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:11
I mean, what does that have to do with being drugged for 48 days?

[GM] 21:54:14
That means you want to forget that embarrassing moment in your life.

[Dex Miro] 21:54:17
Uh, I gotcha. I mean, really, I care more about everybody else forgetting it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:54:18
Or that was day 20.

[Ink] 21:54:21
I know.

[GM] 21:54:24
Well, you… you insist that they party hard, too.

[GM] 21:54:30
Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:54:31
This is why I'm just gonna let Carnoc handle the weapons.

[GM] 21:54:39
Um… Yeah, uh…

[GM] 21:54:44
Maybe that's what we'll do. We'll say that you guys… end up spending, uh…

[Ink] 21:54:46
I think…

[GM] 21:54:50
48 days in… in sort of… whatever various, uh… sinful behaviors you want to engage with.

[GM] 21:54:59
Um… And then we'll say it costs 100 credits a day.

[GM] 21:55:03
Not including, as we'll call it, 110 credits a day for your O2 as well.

[GM] 21:55:09
Um, so… Does anyone not have 4,800 credits?

[Dex Miro] 21:55:15
Oh, I do. I have 8,000.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:21
Is that plus the 10,000 we got, or is the $10,000 for supply?

[GM] 21:55:24
No, 10,000 was only for supplies. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:27
Those should subtract 4,800. Oh, and I don't think I ever took off $300 for the air, and apparently we would have had to pay more during that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:36
My credit box is blank.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:38
Of course it is. That means you have as much as you want.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:55:42
I assume so.

[Dex Miro] 21:55:44
The company took it all for your defragmentation?

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:44
I don't even get a credit box.

[GM] 21:55:46
Um… Okay, I think we already did this with MurderBot, in terms of…

[GM] 21:55:53
So, everyone's taking short leave. That means everyone needs to make a sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 21:55:55
Okay?

[Dex Miro] 21:56:01
Okay.

[GM] 21:56:02
Just don't critically fail.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:03
Doesn't sound great.

[Ink] 21:56:07
36.50. Yep.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:56:09
Oh, boy.

[GM] 21:56:12
Oh, you're the one that's supposed to be able to make these.

[GM] 21:56:14
Cool. Is it… no, Murderbot already did this.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:18
Oh.

[Ink] 21:56:20
Yeah, we have these roles.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:22
So this… this is a save… I guess this is a save.

[Murderbot V2] 21:56:25
Oh, boy.

[Ink] 21:56:28
Here we go. Oh, holy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:31
Everybody's failed.

[Ink] 21:56:34
Oh, go ahead.

[GM] 21:56:34
Everybody failed, except for, kind of, Murderbot. Um… But no one critically failed, which means that.

[GM] 21:56:41
Alright. Do not convert any stress, but relieve all stress, setting the character back to minimum stress, then gain one stress for failing insanity save.

[Ink] 21:56:49
So we go back to 2, add 1, so we're at 3.

[Zeke Sinclair] 21:56:50
Oprah.

[GM] 21:56:51
Yep, yep.

[Dex Miro] 21:56:56
Oh, so you can never go below 2?

[GM] 21:56:59
Uh, there is a specific, I think, panic? Outcome that can reduce… the… your sanity… your minimum sanity.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:09
And you said it was 4,800 credits, right?

[GM] 21:57:10
Or minimum… minimum stress, sorry. Uh, would you say, Carnoc?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:15
4,800 credits.

[GM] 21:57:16
Yeah, it could be a little bit more if you want to pay for your O2 at the same time.

[GM] 21:57:20
As long as you've got the money, it's fine. Um…

[Dex Miro] 21:57:25
Who we should take off. And, like, another $480 for the…

[GM] 21:57:27
Another 480. Yeah. Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 21:57:31
480, okay.

[Dex Miro] 21:57:31
There.

[GM] 21:57:33
Um… while you guys are partying hard at Stellar Burn for…

[GM] 21:57:39
48 days. Uh, you come to know the place pretty well.

[GM] 21:57:43
You know that the bartender's name at, uh… On the first level is… his name's… SEM? Or…

[GM] 21:57:51
Uh, his full name's Jury Semenov. But it goes by some.

[GM] 21:57:57
Uh, he's got a load of drinks. You can get the… chatter, the Moloko, Ambrosia, Victory Gin, Vesper.

[GM] 21:58:08
Cadre Kola… that one's non-alcoholic, so, yeah. Whatever. Smokey, a well drink, a call drink, and a beer.

[GM] 21:58:18
Um, you also come to find out that there's an upper floor.

[GM] 21:58:22
To the, uh, club. Which is called Heaven.

[GM] 21:58:28
Um, it's often used for… private conversations, just private booths, and there's, like, a…

[GM] 21:58:34
Sonic muting system, so that, like. You go up there, you don't hear anything. Um, and then when you're in the booth, you can actually.

[GM] 21:58:41
Talk to each other freely without fear of, uh, anyone eavesdropping.

[GM] 21:58:47
And then on the lower level is a place called The Ecstasy.

[GM] 21:58:52
And this is run by… a person named Indayl.

[GM] 21:58:58
Let me see if I have a picture of Indayl. Yeah, I do.

[GM] 21:59:10
Alright, should be in the middle of the screen. You see her?

[Ink] 21:59:16
Yep. Cool.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:17
Yeah. I'm having a little… there's definitely some mild stuff going on there, but I have a little trouble understanding.

[GM] 21:59:20
Yeah. Uh… Yeah, not only does she have this…

[GM] 21:59:26
Cybernetic eye, uh… at some point, she sticks out her tongue, and it's impossibly long.

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:28
The fuck!

[GM] 21:59:32
And there's, like, it's, like, has a little tip to it.

[GM] 21:59:35
As well.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:39
Can you spell their name?

[GM] 21:59:41
I-n-d-a-y-l. Indayl.

[Dex Miro] 21:59:46
Indayl?

[Murderbot V2] 21:59:48
And who is this girl? They… oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Indul.

[GM] 21:59:51
Uh, they… Yeah, yeah. They.

[Ink] 21:59:53
Not the first…

[GM] 21:59:57
Run the ecstasy, which is the basement, uh… This is where you can get private dances.

[GM] 22:00:05
Uh, hourly rates or overnight stays, if you'd like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:09
Oh, shit, Hex would have loved this.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:13
Can we get some… what is this drug we're looking for? What is it called?

[GM] 22:00:17
Sycorax… You wanna hit that Sycorax?

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:17
Sycorax. Oh, whoa!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:17
I want some of that.

[GM] 22:00:21
Indayl can hook that up. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:00:22
Isn't that expensive?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:25
Can I ask where he's getting it from? Like… I wanna… I wanna… I want a regular source.

[GM] 22:00:27
What…

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:28
Oh, doing some… investigative journalism there, huh?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:34
I guess if it's good…

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:35
Smart man.

[GM] 22:00:36
Yeah, you're gonna have to… you're gonna have to, you know… Indayl can connect you with a supplier.

[GM] 22:00:42
Uh, it's gonna cost you 1 kilo credit a hit. This is… this is the good shit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:00:46
I don't have any… I don't have a kilo credit. Can I… can I borrow drug money from some…

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:48
What does it make… what happens to you? What is, like, the effects of it? Is it just, like, heroin?

[Murderbot V2] 22:00:53
Or is it…? 10 times better than heroin?

[GM] 22:00:53
It is not heroin.

[GM] 22:00:59
Uh, as soon as you have the credits, you let me know. I will… I will hook you up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:03
Hey, Murderbot, can I have some drug money?

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:06
I don't have money! The company doesn't give us money!

[Dex Miro] 22:01:09
Stop calling it drug money.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:13
They don't give us money! What are you talking about money credits? There's no meaning to me.

[Ink] 22:01:24
Can we get a job?

[GM] 22:01:27
You wanna go look for jobs?

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:29
GM, how long are we supposed to finish this mission by? Like, how many… Oh, there's no, like, uh…

[Ink] 22:01:32
We've got a long time, no rush.

[GM] 22:01:34
You got, you got… you got…

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:36
We just have to take it down within… a reasonable amount of time, or there's no, like, oh, you have to accomplish this in, like, 10 days, or…

[GM] 22:01:39
Yeah. The company kind of probably expects that you'll check in when you run out of money, and so…

[GM] 22:01:49
You know.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:01:50
Amount of money, I need a kilo credit.

[Murderbot V2] 22:01:55
How many credits do we all… does everybody have all together?

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:01
Nothing? 3,200 kilo… er, 3,200 credits.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:02
About 3,200 now.

[Ink] 22:02:04
Yeah. That's how I got about how much I got left as well.

[Ink] 22:02:10
After indulging and paying for oxygen.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:14
Yeah.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:02:14
Yeah, I only have 1790.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:14
And is that… is that, like, and that's… that's just, like, what's split up evenly amongst everybody?

[Ink] 22:02:24
No, that's my ink's personal stash. I don't know if… did you get… did you get money as a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:26
Oh, the personal stats, you guys have, like… I don't think so.

[Ink] 22:02:31
Robot?

[GM] 22:02:32
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:02:34
What about the…

[Dex Miro] 22:02:34
Well, he didn't get paid because he's not the same person as the last mission, right? So…

[Ink] 22:02:37
Yeah.

[GM] 22:02:38
Um… With, uh… Muraba hides it well, but his O2 cred stick doesn't ever change.

[GM] 22:02:47
Because he's not breathing.

[Dex Miro] 22:02:49
Okay. How do you fix it?

[GM] 22:02:52
So, yeah.

[Ink] 22:02:54
I take a huff off his every once in a while, because they'll track him and realize.

[GM] 22:03:03
Um… You get to know the station pretty well in those 48 days, um…

[GM] 22:03:11
Uh, there's a place called The Farm. This is, uh… basically a site of, like.

[GM] 22:03:16
It's kind of a holy site, but also a place that produces a lot of food.

[GM] 22:03:22
Um, there is a… they're not quite occults, but, you know, they're kind of occult, um, of…

[GM] 22:03:29
It's called the Solarian Church, and they worship a sun deity, and… Where is the lighting in most of the station is, like, the sort of.

[GM] 22:03:38
Fluorescent lighting, um… you know, it's not very pleasant entering into that place, they've changed the lights to be, you know, as much.

[GM] 22:03:48
Like sunlight as possible. Uh, and there's actually kind of a nice.

[GM] 22:03:53
Feeling of tranquility and serenity there. Uh, you don't have to be necessarily indulging in, like.

[GM] 22:04:00
All kinds of simple behaviors. If you want to hang out at the farm and just, like.

[GM] 22:04:04
Bask in the glow of this tree, there's a giant tree there, um… It's huge. It's like…

[GM] 22:04:12
Like, a giant redwood, essentially. Um… Uh, that's location 5. You also learn about, uh, location.

[Ink] 22:04:26
The stolen… the stolen church is in the farm? Yeah.

[GM] 22:04:26
Uh… Solarian Church is in the farm, yeah.

[GM] 22:04:33
Uh, there's also… The chop shop. Um, this is, like, the most…

[GM] 22:04:39
Reputable place to get cyber modifications, um… You know, that if you need to go and… if you're ever rich enough to be able to do it, you could ask for the babushka, and she'll…

[GM] 22:04:51
She'll hook you up, or chop you up, rather. Um, let's see…

[GM] 22:04:59
If you're looking for work, there's a couple places. Um, there's Tempest Company, which is a mercenary, uh.

[GM] 22:05:10
Group, and you could do mercenary work with them. Um… But you'll start off at a relatively low rank.

[GM] 22:05:18
Uh, job doesn't pay all that well, and in fact, the mercenary company requires.

[GM] 22:05:22
You to kick back, um… How much did they expect you to kick back.

[GM] 22:05:32
10% of all your earned credits. Um…

[GM] 22:05:38
But once you work up in rank, you could probably make some decent money.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:43
Is the kickback, too? You said Mercenary something.

[GM] 22:05:46
Yeah, just the Tempest Company in general. So they hook you up with a job, and then you kick back 10% of what you ever… whatever you make.

[Dex Miro] 22:05:48
Okay. Okay. Okay, gotcha.

[GM] 22:05:54
Um… You also… Another place that you can find work is called the cannonHeavy.market.

[Murderbot V2] 22:05:56
Bless you.

[GM] 22:06:04
Um, or sorry, canyon heavy.market. Um, walking into this place.

[GM] 22:06:11
Uh, is like… A zero-G LAN party.

[GM] 22:06:17
Um, there's just… computers are floating in space with people, like.

[GM] 22:06:21
Hacking away on them, um… the guy in charge of this place is a data broker named Ingus.

[GM] 22:06:29
Um… And he refers to the people that hang out in this space as council cowboys.

[GM] 22:06:37
Um, and… Over the course of time, you figure out that there's a connection between.

[GM] 22:06:44
Um, the people who run this station and… and this group.

[GM] 22:06:48
Uh, that this is the intelligence apparatus of. Golyanovo Il Bratva.

[GM] 22:06:55
Uh, which is the… Um… Bratva.

[Murderbot V2] 22:06:58
Bratva.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:00
One more time on that?

[GM] 22:07:02
G-o-l-y-a-n-o-v-o. And I think it's IL. It's… it looks like two L's next to each other, but I think it's I… like, capital I, capital… or lowercase l.

[GM] 22:07:13
Bratva, B-R-A-T-V-A. I'm trying to think of this, actually, I've been looking around to see if this means anything, but I cannot figure out if this means anything.

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:18
Bratva.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:24
Okay.

[GM] 22:07:26
Uh, but this is the group… essentially, the criminal organization that runs the, uh.

[GM] 22:07:31
The whole station. Um, you find out that this is run by a person named…

[GM] 22:07:37
Yandy?

[Ink] 22:07:41
But I thought… I feel like Gulvangia, or whoever runs the station.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:41
But… wait, which ones?

[GM] 22:07:45
Well, that's the name of the organization, the criminal organization, and it's headed by a person named Dandy.

[Ink] 22:07:48
Oh, gosh.

[Dex Miro] 22:07:51
The organization's name is Golyanovo Il Bratva.

[Murderbot V2] 22:07:54
Let's just call it Bratva. That's Russian.

[GM] 22:07:54
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

[GM] 22:08:01
Does it mean something?

[Ink] 22:08:02
Specifically, the main guy?

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:03
Let's see, let's look it up, because I remember… I remember a movie, something that was, I saw… The guy was talking in Russia, I was like, yeah, I don't even…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:12
Yeah. That's why I just remember that term. Oh, Bradford is a colloquial Russian term for brotherhood.

[GM] 22:08:14
Good, good quote, good quote. There you go.

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:18
Fame, great. So, gang, yeah, there you go.

[GM] 22:08:21
Yeah. So, the leader of the… of Bratva is Yandy. Um, so you're asking around, you…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:31
Zeke is so bored right now!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:34
I'm really tired, it's been a day.

[GM] 22:08:35
He just… he just wants to take his drugs and have a good time.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:39
Yeah, seriously.

[Ink] 22:08:40
They can't afford any.

[GM] 22:08:42
And for a…

[Murderbot V2] 22:08:43
Can't afford it, that means we gotta do some jobs! We gotta do some work.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:08:47
I can't work till I got the drugs, man.

[GM] 22:08:52
Um, you put together that… so, Rafa… uh… is basically… you know, running this whole station, and likely.

[GM] 22:09:02
They are the ones that are, you know, somehow. You know, dealing this drug. Like, you can't imagine that the way that this place works, that…

[GM] 22:09:10
They're not, you know, that they're somehow unaware of the Sycorax.

[GM] 22:09:15
Um. The… you also put together so, like, you know that the, um…

[GM] 22:09:24
Canyon heavy.market is… with Ingus being the, sort of, intelligence arm of the Bratva, that the…

[GM] 22:09:34
Um… Tempest quote.

[GM] 22:09:38
Company is, like, the muscle. Like, the… those mercenaries are typically hired out by the Bratva to either…

[GM] 22:09:46
Have, um, used as… Protection for… the drug running or, you know, to take care of any kind of…

[GM] 22:09:55
Um, issues that maybe need taken care of. Um, there's another location…

[GM] 22:10:02
Of the court, where justice is dispense, that's at 7. Um.

[GM] 22:10:08
The leader, or the sort of, uh, head. Judge or executioner, as some people.

[GM] 22:10:14
Call her as Brunhilde.

[GM] 22:10:20
Um… You know what? Why don't I just do this? I was gonna say.

[Murderbot V2] 22:10:24
Van Hilda. Hilde.

[GM] 22:10:26
Um… So you get descriptions of pretty much everybody.

[GM] 22:10:31
And, like, you know, it's… it's a big station. But you, you know, you've been here for a couple months, you're, you're… kind of… intending to…

[GM] 22:10:42
You know, learn a bunch of things, so you… you… start meeting some of these people.

[GM] 22:10:47
Or at least seeing them from afar. Um, so…

[GM] 22:10:53
On the left here. That's Ingus.

[GM] 22:10:58
And then… in the middle… upper… middle.

[GM] 22:11:04
Is, uh, Brunhilde.

[GM] 22:11:12
Um… the leader of the Solarian Church. Is Uku… Uku Oka.

[GM] 22:11:19
And that person you can see on the right.

[Dex Miro] 22:11:29
Can you spell that?

[GM] 22:11:31
U-k-k-o slash U-K-K-A.

[Murderbot V2] 22:11:38
What kind of woke game is this shit, man?

[GM] 22:11:43
I don't know if it's because… They're, like, binary… non-binary, or what, or if it's just because, like, maybe they have a split personality.

[GM] 22:11:57
It doesn't get into it. Leaves it open for interpretation.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:01
Sure. Okay. Alright guys, I… so, let's… Let's… let's… are we all together right now? Are we, like, all sitting together? Or, like, are we all, like…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:12:12
In the bar, having a drink.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:13
I mean, we've been all over the station for almost 2 months.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:14
And the bar having a drink. GM, do we have, like, a… a room somewhere, like a… like a base of operations? Do we have, like, a… are we renting a place, or…?

[GM] 22:12:23
Yeah, you rent a place. Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:24
We're renting a place? Okay.

[Dex Miro] 22:12:24
Oh, man, how much did that cost us?

[Ink] 22:12:27
You can't just sleep there, you can't sleep on our shit.

[GM] 22:12:30
Uh, you could sleep on the ship, probably.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:33
Or do we want to use the ship as the base of operation? Like… Is it like a spaceport where we can just go in and out of our ship, like, as we please?

[Dex Miro] 22:12:39
Oh, no. Do we have to get decontaminated every day if we stay on the ship?

[GM] 22:12:42
You have to get decontaminated every time. Okay. Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:12:45
Oh, no, but I don't want to stay at the show.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:45
Alright, then… And they, like, I kind of like the shower at the end of the day.

[Ink] 22:12:46
I kind of like it, though.

[Ink] 22:12:54
I don't bother showering each day, I just, you know… Yeah, I just moisturize because it's pretty rare.

[Murderbot V2] 22:12:56
Let me just get decontaminated.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:12:57
You already have the washer stuff, they, like, do it for you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:01
Alright, we can stay on the ship, that's fine. We'll call the ship at the base of operations.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:06
Um. Can we get a list of our… of who we need… how… what we need to do, and then start from there, and like…

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:15
Come up with strategies from there.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:18
I mean, I don't think there's really a list.

[Ink] 22:13:20
We gotta… we just need to kill Dandy and blow up the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:20
Yeah, I know, but there's, like, we needed… we need a…

[GM] 22:13:25
You do what you want. You can blow up the station if you want.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:26
Randy?

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:26
Dandy? Yandy, we need to kill Yandy and blow up the station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:32
No, we don't have to blow up the station, right? Or do we have to blow up the station, GM?

[Dex Miro] 22:13:33
I mean, I suppose that technically fits the criteria of killing the leaders.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:39
Well, the… Alright, the mission was to stop PsychoRX production, am I right?

[Dex Miro] 22:13:45
But… but I'm not really into mass murder.

[GM] 22:13:50
Uh, I think that the fundamental mission is to figure out.

[Dex Miro] 22:13:50
Yeah. Boom.

[GM] 22:13:53
Where they're producing and who's producing it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:13:56
Okay, where they're producing it, and who's producing it, that's what we're trying to find out.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:02
But we've already… I mean, don't we have. We already know this, no?

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:08
Well, we just know the dealers right now.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:08
No. Yeah.

[GM] 22:14:11
You haven't met any dealers yet, because no one's forked over 1 kilo credit's worth of…

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:15
I know, but from, like, when you were telling, like, what was that… what the weird tongue… Yeah, yeah.

[GM] 22:14:19
You… you know how to get in touch with a dealer if you talk to Indayl, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:24
Yeah, yeah, she's… she's a dealer, not a… not a… not a… a create… not… what am I saying? What a creator? Not creator.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:32
Um, not a… not a producer. She doesn't cook.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:35
She doesn't cook.

[GM] 22:14:37
But they don't take kindly to you mis-gendering them.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:40
Oh, they… ugh. God damn! It! I would call it IT from now on.

[GM] 22:14:48
They're like, you know, so 20th century of you. Boomer.

[Dex Miro] 22:14:49
I don't think people like that.

[Murderbot V2] 22:14:52
Oh my god! Oh my god! This is my, my, my, my…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:02
My processing cannot… My old processors cannot, uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:15:05
No, shut up. My friend's really drunk, he thinks he's a murderer, but he's not.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:14
Okay, so… We have to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:19
Find out who's producing and who is… Where it's being produced. Is that correct?

[Dex Miro] 22:15:27
So, I, like, work at the bar or something, and maybe I can overhear some stuff.

[Dex Miro] 22:15:33
Seems like a good place to look for things.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:34
GM, is that… is that okay with you, though, in this mission, do you… is it okay if all of us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:40
Go do our own little things, and do our own little, like… investigating, like, everyone has a side thing, or do you want us to more…

[GM] 22:15:49
I don't care. Yeah. So Dex's getting a job at the bar.

[Murderbot V2] 22:15:49
Um, you don't care.

[GM] 22:15:55
What do you want to learn?

[Dex Miro] 22:15:58
I don't know, just kind of… listen around to people and see if anybody's talking about something interesting, although it's probably pretty loud in there, but…

[GM] 22:16:06
Yeah, I mean, you know… You make not a ton of money, um…

[GM] 22:16:11
You know, enough to cover, like, your daily expenses and stuff, but not… not a whole lot more.

[GM] 22:16:17
Um, you've heard that the crackdown from the company on the Sycorax runners.

[GM] 22:16:26
Has really strained the relationship between the Teamsters Union and, um… And uh… and the…

[GM] 22:16:34
Broad fuss. There's a bit of… there's a bit of unrest.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:42
Is the Teamsters Union, like, a… big… galaxy-wide organization or something?

[GM] 22:16:48
Uh, yes and no. There are specific unions, you know, so, like, you're probably not in the same union as this one, but you're, you know.

[Dex Miro] 22:16:57
Okay.

[GM] 22:16:58
They'd recognize you as a fellow Teamster. Not, like, not by looks, necessarily, but like, you know, if you're like, I'm from…

[GM] 22:17:08
Union number, blah blah blah. I could probably… oh, local… this… this Teamsters local is 32819L.

[GM] 22:17:20
So, that's… that's their particular local union. You're probably not a part of that.

[Dex Miro] 22:17:29
I think you gave me a different number last time, so…

[GM] 22:17:32
Did I? It's written on the page right here, distributed by Teamsters Local.

[GM] 22:17:37
32819l. Oh, yeah, probably.

[Dex Miro] 22:17:38
No, I mean, you give me a different number, personally. Yeah, yeah.

[GM] 22:17:47
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:17:53
Yeah, so maybe just the, uh… higher-ups at the station, don't come in here too often, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:18:01
I was hoping to catch some, uh… After work, people complaining about their boss type chatter, but…

[GM] 22:18:08
Um, you do hear that… Ingus has, uh… he pays really well for work.

[GM] 22:18:16
Um, but you kind of have to gain his trust before… Before he gives it to you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:23
I think this is tough left.

[GM] 22:18:24
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:18:26
Yeah, I want to go work for Ingus with convince Murderbot to join me, too, because it's computer work, right?

[Dex Miro] 22:18:27
That's funny.

[GM] 22:18:31
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:31
Alright, I'll go do that. How do we get in the good graces of Ingus?

[GM] 22:18:36
You gotta win some land games.

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:38
Oh, fuck. That's fine with me, I can do that. I have computer as a skill.

[GM] 22:18:44
Um… Okay, uh…

[GM] 22:18:54
Let's see… you go to…

[Murderbot V2] 22:18:57
And I spake in a Scottish accent, Ingus.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:19:01
I'll be back in a bit. Hold on.

[GM] 22:19:01
Oh, shit. Did I never create these?

[Dex Miro] 22:19:02
No, you… no, you don't. I feel like Ink could have stopped you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:09
Are you sure? Absolutely!

[Dex Miro] 22:19:10
Yes, I'm sure it would stop you.

[GM] 22:19:16
Yeah, okay. I don't have a map. I thought I had a map, but I don't have a map.

[GM] 22:19:19
Um, you enter into, uh… Canyon-heavy Markets.

[GM] 22:19:27
Um… into the battle stations area.

[GM] 22:19:31
It's 0G. So, like, you go from, like, walking, and then suddenly you're just, like, sort of floating through the space.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:36
Oh, so it's not, like, land games, it's, like, real games.

[GM] 22:19:36
That's a rough sphere. Kinda. Uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:19:41
Like, kind of like zero-G laser tag or something, I don't know.

[GM] 22:19:45
Yeah, uh… Yes and no. I mean, there's a bunch of work, uh, you know, it's a rough sphere of workspace coded in multi-terminal workstations, so there's just, like, computers all over the place.

[Murderbot V2] 22:19:57
Oh, jeez.

[Dex Miro] 22:19:57
Okay.

[GM] 22:19:57
Um, it's under-lit in a neon green, uh… And people are like.

[GM] 22:20:04
They'll, like, kick off between spaces. And they… you'll see, like, a group of them gather around one terminal, and they'll be, like, cheering somebody on.

[GM] 22:20:13
Um, and they will be talking in an incomprehensible language. It's effectively like.

[GM] 22:20:19
Leet-speak on steroids. They just speak it, though. They're not even.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:24
Pound!

[GM] 22:20:24
Yeah. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:20:29
What was that that? Oh, okay, gotcha.

[Murderbot V2] 22:20:30
You've been pounded! I don't know. I am…

[GM] 22:20:35
Fucking with my call sign, you're fucking it up, man. Um… but they call them, like, when they do a hack, they, like, so they're hackers, and they… they basically call them clan games, and so they'll…

[GM] 22:20:49
Um, to them, like, you know, they don't really seemingly take it too serious.

[GM] 22:20:54
And, in fact, like, they… there's this huge scoreboard that sort of floats in the center of the room.

[GM] 22:21:02
Um, but you've… you've… you get the sense that, like. You know, what they're calling games here is, like.

[GM] 22:21:07
Heavy criminal activity of stealing information and whatnot.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:12
It's a heck of one.

[GM] 22:21:14
Um… Alright.

[GM] 22:21:23
Your… your mission. You want a mission? You walk in, like, let's see what you can do.

[GM] 22:21:32
They don't give you a hacking mission. They give you some other shit.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:34
Oh, Jesus. The hell?

[GM] 22:21:36
What do they give you?

[GM] 22:21:44
Nope.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:48
Oh, man, it's a hacking mission, man. Oh, no.

[GM] 22:21:52
Four. Oh, boy.

[Murderbot V2] 22:21:57
What is this shit? What?

[GM] 22:21:59
Um… They… so…

[GM] 22:22:03
One of the things you guys have heard about on the station is that, um.

[GM] 22:22:07
So in Parts 9 and 10 of the station. Uh, are the choke.

[GM] 22:22:14
So, the… there's an area down there called DOPTown.

[GM] 22:22:22
And… that's short for deoxygenated People's Town. Um, and that's, like, the entrance into the choke.

[GM] 22:22:31
And the, sort of. Class warfare, insofar as that people who have been relegated to the choke.

[GM] 22:22:40
Um, there's been a resistance that's been brewing. And the leader of that resistance is named Imogene Kane.

[GM] 22:22:47
And so, your mission, if you choose to accept it. Is to contact Imogene Kane.

[GM] 22:22:53
You just have to… just have to get ahold of her. You don't have to do anything else.

[GM] 22:22:57
But it requires that you go into DOPTown. Um, Mission pays 10 kilo credits.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:06
Zeke's ears perked up when you said 10 kilo credits.

[Dex Miro] 22:23:12
That's the mission that Ink and Murderbot got offered.

[GM] 22:23:15
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:16
Man, I was just looking forward to just typing stuff on a computer, and… packing it that way…

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:26
Alright, where do we find this imaging cane, or whatever? I know!

[Ink] 22:23:28
In DOPTown.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:31
So… What is… what is the DOPTown you say it was, like, some…

[Dex Miro] 22:23:33
I mean, if you want to really endure yourself, you just stop paying for air, and they'll take you there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:23:40
Deoxygenated, or whatever. Mm-hmm.

[GM] 22:23:43
The oxygenated Peoples Town?

[Ink] 22:23:45
Can I get another one of those oxygen card things?

[GM] 22:23:49
Um. Yes, but that's not what actually supplies you with the oxygen, that just tracks, like, how much oxygen you're breathing while you're in this area.

[Ink] 22:23:57
Yeah, I guess that. I just… I just want one that's empty.

[GM] 22:24:01
Okay. Um…

[Ink] 22:24:02
There's no credit.

[GM] 22:24:06
You can't… As much as one can say, legally speaking, get it.

[GM] 22:24:12
But you're… you're able to find somebody that gives you. Like, yeah, I'll sell you this cred stick I found it on a…

[GM] 22:24:18
A dead body.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:20
Jesus. Alright, so we have to go into this dot town to find this imaging.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:24
What's her face?

[GM] 22:24:26
They sell you the cred stick for 100 credits. It's got… it's got no credits on it.

[Ink] 22:24:30
Democrats, alright.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:31
Right, GM? We have to find this imaging cane in this top town.

[GM] 22:24:35
Yeah, to find her, you'd have to go down.

[Ink] 22:24:36
Yeah, we can find, too, one for me, one for Murderbot.

[GM] 22:24:40
Yeah, you could get another one for 200 credits this time.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:43
I need one, too. Well, uh… I ain't got no money.

[Ink] 22:24:44
Oh, shit. I got… I gotta buy both of them, because Murderbot has no money.

[Ink] 22:24:49
Good thing he can hold his breath forever.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:51
Well, whatever I make, you'll probably take it, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:24:53
Yeah, didn't… they would have already given it one, right? He could just stop paying, and… well, maybe he wants one that he can show people.

[Murderbot V2] 22:24:59
I'm just saying, whatever I get paid in the… in… in whatever job.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:00
So he's not out.

[Ink] 22:25:02
If he's… if he's found with… without credit on his thing, then he'll get… forced and adapt to it, but… so I wanted to kind of control that.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:06
Right. So, depending on what situation you want to be in, now you could pretend, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:12
Now, do we have to commit crimes to go to DOPTown, or no?

[Dex Miro] 22:25:12
That's nice.

[GM] 22:25:16
Nope, there's just a giant, uh… Uh… What? Thing that takes you down there.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:21
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:25:25
What do they call him? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:26
Elevators? What?

[Ink] 22:25:28
Turbolift.

[GM] 22:25:29
Yeah, TurboLift.

[Dex Miro] 22:25:30
Do you have to, like, scan your credit stick every time you go between different areas of the station, and then the alarm goes off if you're at zero or something?

[GM] 22:25:38
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:25:39
It's okay, okay, so, okay, all right, well, let's… Let's go down to DOPTown.

[GM] 22:25:44
Uh, you're… you're stopped at the gate to the, uh… the turbo lift.

[GM] 22:25:51
Uh, you see. Printed in graffiti next to the, like, uh, the gate is a… it just, like, in quotes, airlock.

[GM] 22:26:01
Uh, in, in, uh, graffiti. Um… They tell you, like, if you're planning on going down there, you'll want to bring extra oxygen.

[GM] 22:26:13
You know, um… And, uh, it's pretty dangerous.

[GM] 22:26:20
People see you with extra oxygen, just the two-year going down there.

[Ink] 22:26:24
Okay, so here's…

[GM] 22:26:25
They might gang up on you and steal your oxygen. You might want… You might want more… more people with you.

[Ink] 22:26:30
Gotcha. Um, can Murderbot take, like, a big breath into his lungs?

[GM] 22:26:31
Hire some mercenaries.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:31
Uh…

[Ink] 22:26:36
And then every once in a while, I'll make out with Murderbot, and he'll breathe into my mouth.

[Murderbot V2] 22:26:41
What is happening? Murder map does not consent! Oh, yeah, I can't… I can't refuse if Carnoc tells… gives me orders, too, so…

[Dex Miro] 22:26:42
That is where I thought that was going, okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:26:43
How do they not have any oxygen?

[GM] 22:26:47
Only if Carnoc tells them to.

[Ink] 22:26:47
It's not gay, it's not gay because Murderbot is an android.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:26:56
Yeah. I mean, do you even have anywhere to hold oxygen inside your body?

[Dex Miro] 22:26:57
Oh, that's right.

[GM] 22:27:02
He can't pressurize his lungs, I don't think, in such a way as to hold a significant amount of air.

[GM] 22:27:10
But you can… you can easily go and buy, like, an O2 canister that'll last for, like, 12 hours.

[Ink] 22:27:17
Oh, but that's not near as cool.

[Ink] 22:27:23
Alright, let's go buy one of these O2 canisters that'll last 12 hours.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:27:23
Well, so…

[Ink] 22:27:28
5,000 credits.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:27:31
What do the people breathe down? I don't understand how this works.

[GM] 22:27:35
Oh, you'll see. Um… how much is an O2 canister? I think it's actually…

[Ink] 22:27:41
And I get, like, a little… a little plants? That can convert oxygen.

[Dex Miro] 22:27:41
Yeah, I know what that plan is that I shouldn't go there.

[GM] 22:27:53
Oxygen tank. 50 credits.

[Ink] 22:28:16
Hey, I gotta buy a $50 credit O2 tank. And then, uh, recruit the rest of the… rest of… what's our gang's name?

[Dex Miro] 22:28:45
I don't think… no, not that… No, it isn't.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:45
Well, fellas, boys…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:28:46
Yeah, of course it is. Of course it is.

[Murderbot V2] 22:28:53
Um, do I need to buy a tank just to give the, uh, image of… yeah.

[GM] 22:28:57
Illusion of…

[Ink] 22:28:59
Oh, can we get an empty tank for, like, you know, half price?

[GM] 22:29:02
Yeah, you can get an empty tank for half price.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:04
But that's the problem. We're gonna… do we need the whole group with us? Because… if they see us, too, with two tanks, they're gonna be coming at us, aren't they?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:29:08
Sounds like it.

[Ink] 22:29:09
Okay. Well, we all need a tank, and we need some muscle, and we need some non-armor-piercing weapons on us, as well.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:29:13
Yeah.

[Ink] 22:29:21
Right?

[GM] 22:29:25
I mean, you've been warned about the. Maybe, uh, what?

[GM] 22:29:32
Lawlessness of DOPTown.

[Dex Miro] 22:29:34
Yeah, but…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:29:38
I mean, you probably don't want to be seen as someone who… still has credits and able to buy oxygen at all.

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:46
Yeah, we can't… I don't know, I don't know how we're gonna play this, cause…

[Murderbot V2] 22:29:51
We have to kind of, like, go in there looking like… beggars, right?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:29:58
Yeah.

[GM] 22:29:59
Uh, while you're standing next to, like, the… the TurboLift area, you see, like.

[GM] 22:30:06
Um. A guy who… he… he doesn't look like he's got a ton of money, but he's got…

[GM] 22:30:12
Six heavily armed guards around him. He enters into the… into the air… uh, the airlock, and…

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:14
Jesus.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:19
Okay, so it seems like as long as you look like you have muscle, they won't touch you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:30:24
Oh, I'm a muscle.

[Murderbot V2] 22:30:24
Maybe?

[Ink] 22:30:25
Well, he doesn't have much money, but he's able to hire these guards. Where do you… where do you hire… hey, buddy, where'd you hire those guys?

[GM] 22:30:30
Oh, these are Tempest Company.

[Ink] 22:30:34
Alright, let's go to Tempest Company real quick. How much… how many credits are those guys a day?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:30:36
What's Tempest come?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:30:40
There's a different company than the company?

[GM] 22:30:40
Uh… Yeah, they're a different company than a company.

[GM] 22:30:48
Um, they are… Let's see… what is a bodyguard go for?

[GM] 22:31:00
Uh, probably 1,000 credits a day. Each one?

[Ink] 22:31:05
How many… how much? Sorry. Thousand? Man, I thought this guy didn't look like he had money. He's walking around with $6,000 worth of… credits worth of guys.

[GM] 22:31:06
1,000 credits? 1 kilo credit.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:31:07
Per card.

[GM] 22:31:14
Maybe he's trying not to look like he has a lot of money, but then he also has 6,000 credits worth of guys following around.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:31:19
Per day.

[Ink] 22:31:22
Uh… Hey buddy, any chance I can give you 1,000 credits to join you?

[GM] 22:31:28
I don't trust you. Get out of here!

[Ink] 22:31:30
Yeah, okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:31:33
Try.

[Ink] 22:31:39
All right, where's… where's Karnak? He doesn't cost a thousand… he doesn't cost $1,000.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:31:41
I'm here. Yeah. But… how do I get access to weapons? Like, we had to leave all our weapons on the ship, right?

[Ink] 22:31:50
We can bring… we can bring in non-armor-piercing weapons. Right?

[Dex Miro] 22:31:52
Yeah, you can bring your pulse rifle, you just can't bring your new toy.

[GM] 22:31:53
Yeah. Yeah, the… the super gun that you got, uh, that has to stay…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:31:53
No. Okay.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:31:59
Yeah, okay.

[Ink] 22:32:01
And we're all awesome shots with guns, so this is great.

[GM] 22:32:02
On the ship.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:32:05
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:05
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:08
I'm never gonna fire a mortar again.

[GM] 22:32:09
Carnoc's actually a really good shot when he's not under a lot of… a ton of pressure, you know, when he's just, like, at the firing range, he's totally… he's… he can hit that bullseye, like, 9 times out of 10.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:32:14
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:18
So he says…

[GM] 22:32:20
No, he demonstrates it. That might even be his, uh, his downtime, surely, but just… renting guns at the rifle range, and…

[GM] 22:32:31
Shooting guns.

[GM] 22:32:40
Um, so is the whole crew going to DOPTown, then?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:32:44
I think that makes sense, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 22:32:45
I guess so. I mean, it seems dangerous to go… Alone, take this.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:32:52
Yeah.

[GM] 22:32:55
Um… alright. Everyone gets, uh, their own canister.

[GM] 22:33:00
Uh, even if it's empty. Um, it actually…

[GM] 22:33:05
Isn't… would not be abnormal for you guys to, like, wear your hazard suits?

[GM] 22:33:09
Down there, um, because it's an easy way to essentially affix the O2 canisters to your.

[GM] 22:33:16
Um… to your body. Like, there's an easy, like, sort of rebreather and stuff.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:23
Did… did we have to pay for those, then? No, like, the oxygen tanks, or do we have those on the ship?

[GM] 22:33:25
Your hazard suits?

[GM] 22:33:31
Um… you probably had to pay for them. I don't know why you would have had… Separate oxygen tank.

[Dex Miro] 22:33:39
The hazard suit doesn't already have one, I guess. Probably not.

[GM] 22:33:39
So… No, I don't think you would have had a reason to have one previously.

[GM] 22:33:49
Um. Alright. You guys head down the, uh…

[GM] 22:33:57
Down the, uh, turbo lift. It's big. It's like, you know, this thing is used to move.

[GM] 22:34:04
Heavy machinery, um… you know, it could easily fit, like.

[GM] 22:34:09
A small spaceship in it, um… A lot of people gather, but they don't fill up the space.

[GM] 22:34:16
You know, it doesn't seem like this is, like, uh… thing that people are really interested in doing for, you know, on a daily basis.

[GM] 22:34:25
Um… I think… it doesn't take a ton of time, uh, to get down there.

[GM] 22:34:36
Uh, when the doors open, there's actually, like, kind of a rush of air.

[GM] 22:34:42
Um, that enters into the… the space station away from.

[GM] 22:34:46
Away from your, um, the TurboLift. And you can kind of see it's dark.

[GM] 22:34:52
In the area. Um, there's not a ton of light. Um, and you see, sort of.

[GM] 22:34:58
Not far away, um… heavily armored guards.

[GM] 22:35:04
Um, and they have, like, essentially. Almost, like, built up, like, a bunker around… this… this, uh, turbo lift.

[GM] 22:35:12
And there's heavy, like, heavy weaponry, fire, like, pointed in the direction, uh, away from the gate.

[GM] 22:35:20
Um, and you see just beyond the heavy weaponry. Is, like, groups of people, and when the doors open.

[GM] 22:35:27
And this rush of air comes out. You see the people sort of, like, trying to gasp and gather the air into their lungs.

[GM] 22:35:35
Um.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:37
So the… do they keep it at, like, a very minimal oxygen level down here, where, like.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:42
People won't die, but you're out of breath if you even try to move, or…

[GM] 22:35:49
Um, it's… it's low enough that over time, you will just die. Like, you'll be deprived enough over time that your body… body will just shut down.

[Dex Miro] 22:35:52
Okay.

[GM] 22:35:58
Um. Everyone needs to…

[Dex Miro] 22:36:00
So, like, we came down here, like, willingly, or we got escorted because we showed people the MTO2 sticks?

[GM] 22:36:07
No, you came down here willingly. You can… you can freely move about the station. You can come down here willingly. It's just dangerous to do so.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:09
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:36:14
At least they told you it's dangerous. Um.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:16
Right.

[GM] 22:36:19
When you see this, uh, everyone needs to make a fear save.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:39
Critical fail in my… oh, no, success. It's critical success, yeah.

[GM] 22:36:41
No, critical success.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:36:43
I'm scared of nothing.

[Dex Miro] 22:36:46
Okay, I fell. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 22:36:50
I'm sorry, what were we… what were we doing? Fear?

[Dex Miro] 22:36:52
Was I supposed… was I supposed to gain a stress when I felt my earlier save for the… Um, whatever, for the…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:36:53
Fear.

[GM] 22:36:53
Fair save.

[GM] 22:36:57
Yes. Yes. The sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 22:37:01
Fear.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:02
Short leave, yeah. Okay, and another one now.

[GM] 22:37:05
Mm-hmm.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:09
Okay, nice, man. Oh, wow. 72 Target. Look at you, Android.

[GM] 22:37:12
Um…

[Ink] 22:37:16
Hmm.

[GM] 22:37:18
Let's see, what happens as a result of… seeks not being afraid of, like.

[GM] 22:37:26
Essentially running out of oxygen. Um…

[GM] 22:37:33
Huh.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:38
I'm not afraid, because I invented an oxygen production machine. I will…

[GM] 22:37:47
Sure. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:37:47
Cell for drug money.

[Dex Miro] 22:37:49
The catch is, he only thinks it works.

[GM] 22:37:51
Okay, you're like, boy… If only I had my oxygen production machine nearby.

[GM] 22:37:57
I can make a shitload of money. Maybe these people will buy it if they can scrap together enough money for it.

[GM] 22:38:05
Um… Okay, absolutely. That's… that's what happens. You…

[GM] 22:38:11
Zeke? Like, kind of casually strolls out of this, like, you know, into this.

[GM] 22:38:17
Weight of people, and starts talking to people about how he can bring oxygen back to this, uh… this place. If only he could get paid enough.

[GM] 22:38:25
Um, this… this starts a train reaction of, like, people… lighting up, like, you usually see Hope sort of filling their eyes, and they're like.

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:27
Doing.

[GM] 22:38:34
How can we get… how can we get enough… enough money?

[Murderbot V2] 22:38:38
Oh my god.

[GM] 22:38:40
And so, uh, like, rumors of… of this man and his ability to, like, bring oxygen to the.

[GM] 22:38:46
To DOPTown, it spreads like wildfire. Um… you can hear, like, sort of, like, just people just passing this around, and um…

[GM] 22:38:56
Uh, this… guy in army fatigues, um…

[GM] 22:39:02
Strides up next to the rest of the party and says.

[GM] 22:39:05
Uh, you know, him spreading that rumor around is gonna get him torn to shreds when he can't produce.

[GM] 22:39:09
Right. They're not… they're not gonna take kindly to being misled.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:10
Oh, no. Oh, no!

[Dex Miro] 22:39:11
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:15
What did you do!

[Dex Miro] 22:39:16
Are you sure this was crit success?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:17
I am not misleading anyone, I know how to do this. You just recycle the carbon dioxide in the air, plus the evaporated moisture with your.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:39:27
Inductor, condenser… apparati, and um… Hmm, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:33
Talking out of their ass!

[GM] 22:39:38
He's a scientist, he makes it sound real good. No one suspects that this is all just so we can get some drug money.

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:40
Yup. Apparently. Yep.

[Dex Miro] 22:39:45
But, like, if anybody had money, they would have just bought air, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:39:51
Impressive.

[GM] 22:39:51
Um…

[Dex Miro] 22:39:54
You're not going to get funding down here, right? I guess the question is, do we think anybody lives down here just because they…

[GM] 22:39:58
Uh…

[Dex Miro] 22:40:03
Don't want to be part of the system, and they just want their own heir instead of the station heir? I don't know.

[GM] 22:40:09
Uh, you think that likely… I mean, there's always a person, right? But, like.

[GM] 22:40:16
99.9% of these people are… Here, because they can't afford the oxygen, and…

[GM] 22:40:23
Um, the looks of desperation amongst these people, I mean, like, you see… Actually, I have to roll. What do you see?

[GM] 22:40:31
Let's roll. One, uh, no, I don't want to do one.

[GM] 22:40:37
Like, you just see, like, yeah, like, you look around and you see, like, dead bodies.

[GM] 22:40:41
Just, like, dead bodies, and they're not decomposing, because there's not enough oxygen to decompose them.

[GM] 22:40:48
So they're just, like… you know, just dead bodies around.

[GM] 22:40:52
So, chances of someone wanting to live down here seems slim to none.

[GM] 22:40:58
Even if they disagree with what's happening. In the rest of Prospero's dream.

[GM] 22:41:07
Um…

[GM] 22:41:12
Let's see… The, uh, the guy that warned you about spreading these rumors of you being able to fix the…

[GM] 22:41:20
The, you know, unbreathable air. Uh, he hands you guys some passes. He says.

[GM] 22:41:27
Don't lose your pass. You lose your pass, and you won't be able to get back up into… the dream.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:41:37
Oh, man.

[GM] 22:41:43
Um… You walk a little bit further out into, uh, Dop Town.

[GM] 22:41:49
It's kind of like a shanty town, um… Though the… the buildings themselves are…

[GM] 22:41:55
You know, not made of just, like. Uh, wood and, like.

[GM] 22:42:01
Sheet metal. They're more advanced than that, like, they… they look… Not unlike the rest of the area, but they've been certainly run down.

[GM] 22:42:09
Um, you see the… that guy who came down with the six guards, he's at, um… an area, so it looks like an open-air market.

[GM] 22:42:20
Um, and… there are people bidding on, um…

[GM] 22:42:24
You're not sure what. You get a little bit closer and you realize that they're bidding on any kind of service, um…

[GM] 22:42:32
That you can imagine. And this guy is basically. Um, paying people to…

[GM] 22:42:39
Uh… cut off their own fingers. Um, and he collects them.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:42:46
Oh.

[GM] 22:42:51
Uh, and that payment… that it gives them is, like, he basically pulls out, like, oxygen tanks for them.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:43:08
It's a great place down here, guys.

[GM] 22:43:13
Um…

[GM] 22:43:19
Travel a little further, um… get to the… the cramped area of DOPTown, uh, called The Slums.

[GM] 22:43:28
Um. Yeah, it gets worse.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:43:29
It's, like, a worse area. I like the dead bodies. I'm gonna go in the slums now.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:32
It's somehow worse on the market.

[Dex Miro] 22:43:37
I mean, they did tell us not to go here.

[GM] 22:43:38
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:45
What was her name again? Imani Lani, Lilana.

[Murderbot V2] 22:43:51
Lyra Imaging.

[GM] 22:43:52
Imogene Kane. Um, you…

[Dex Miro] 22:43:55
Close. Sorry.

[GM] 22:43:56
You're walking around the slums for a while, uh, and then… Are you, like, asking around for her?

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:06
Yes. Where is Emma Jane Cain?

[GM] 22:44:07
Okay. You're asking around…

[GM] 22:44:19
People don't really respond to you, um, there are plenty of beggars that come up, they sort of, like, weakly grope at you, um, but you guys.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:27
Slap him away.

[GM] 22:44:27
Look like… look like a strong enough force that, like, you know, no one… seems to, like, um…

[GM] 22:44:35
Really mess with you as you slap one away, like, you notice… on their neck, they have these lines, and you can see that they're flesh.

[GM] 22:44:45
It's sort of separated on their neck, and, like, part of the flesh is moving.

[Murderbot V2] 22:44:50
What the fuck? But what the fuck?

[GM] 22:44:50
Um, it reminds you of, like, fish skills.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:02
Oh my god!

[Dex Miro] 22:45:05
Work, but I was the… Like, that's still just trying to breathe normally.

[Dex Miro] 22:45:10
Right? How does that work?

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:11
There's… gills!

[GM] 22:45:13
Do you ask the person?

[Dex Miro] 22:45:15
Yeah, does that help you breathe down here?

[GM] 22:45:20
A little bit better. It's kind of, um… you know, I'm not gonna die.

[GM] 22:45:26
But it's… it's not great. I'd rather be breathing that sweet, sweet… Purified air.

[GM] 22:45:34
Wait, are you… are you the scientist that said he could bring… Air? Air down here?

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:37
Oh my god. No, get away!

[Dex Miro] 22:45:40
No, I…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:45:41
Yes, I just… but I don't have my equipment.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:43
Oh, Jesus Christ.

[GM] 22:45:46
Oh, well, I hope you can bring some equipment soon. We'd all be grateful for it.

[Murderbot V2] 22:45:53
We are gonna get ripped apart.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:45:54
Me too.

[GM] 22:45:56
The person runs off, um… And, uh, a few minutes later, you notice that, like.

[Dex Miro] 22:46:02
A little late, huh?

[GM] 22:46:03
The streets have cleared. And there's 5, uh… heavily armed men walking towards you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:10
Oh, fuck.

[GM] 22:46:13
Uh… they approach you, they're like. Heard you wanted to speak with Imogene Kane.

[GM] 22:46:21
Well, we're here to take you to her. Just follow us.

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:21
Yes? Okay…

[Murderbot V2] 22:46:27
Okay…

[GM] 22:46:33
That kind of surrounds you a little bit, like, two of them, like, fall in behind, like.

[GM] 22:46:38
The rear of your party. Um, and they… they kind of lead you through the slums.

[GM] 22:46:43
To, uh… it looks like it's abandoned from the outside, um… residents, uh… But they open the door, and inside, uh, is, uh…

[GM] 22:46:54
A woman sitting at a table. Um, and uh…

[GM] 22:46:59
She looks up at you when you enter. Says, so you're… you're the scientist.

[GM] 22:47:07
That says they can fix… This place returned the air to us.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:15
If I only had my equipment, the theory is sound. Oh, amazing!

[GM] 22:47:19
Okay, well that's good, because I have equipment. Yeah. Uh, there's a broken life support tower not far from here.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:30
Broken life support tower, okay. Where's that?

[GM] 22:47:32
Yeah. Um… She…

[GM] 22:47:39
Pulls out a digital map. Um, it's a 4-hour walk.

[GM] 22:47:44
Just north of us.

[Dex Miro] 22:47:48
4 hours. Man, this place is huge.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:47:51
Yeah.

[GM] 22:47:52
Uh, it is hard to get a sense of. How big this place is?

[GM] 22:47:58
Um, because there's not a ton of lighting. Um, but she says, yeah.

[GM] 22:48:03
This place is huge. This is just DOPTown.

[GM] 22:48:07
There's a whole nother city sunken in waste. Not far from here.

[GM] 22:48:12
Um, but you don't need to go there. Um, where you need to go is the life support tower.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:19
What equipment is there?

[GM] 22:48:21
Uh… probably everything you need. Uh, you know, I'm not a scientist, I'm not an engineer, I'm not here to fix that, but…

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:25
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:48:30
Well, the tower is apparently broken, so…

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:35
What did we get in return for this?

[GM] 22:48:37
Oh, I have… I have the tools, I have the… I have a repair team that's… recently left. Uh, they had all the tools that were necessary to fix it.

[GM] 22:48:46
Um, but I haven't heard from them since.

[GM] 22:48:53
The… what do you get paid? Is that what you asked?

[Murderbot V2] 22:48:54
Sure. Yeah.

[GM] 22:48:59
Uh, you get our eternal gratitude.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:49:02
So this life support tower used to supply oxygen to this, uh, deoxygenated zone?

[Murderbot V2] 22:49:02
It's not good enough.

[GM] 22:49:07
Yes. You definitely can fix that.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:49:08
And it's just broken. Yeah, I can fix that.

[Dex Miro] 22:49:12
What's so hot. What is nobody else on the station and want to fix it?

[Ink] 22:49:17
Well, who's keeping those guys from getting to it. Um, what do we know about her? She's a resistance leader, GM?

[GM] 22:49:24
Uh, yes. She apparently has been raising an insurgency.

[GM] 22:49:30
And, um… That's, you know… probably threatens, uh, the Bratva a little bit, hence why…

[GM] 22:49:39
Ingus wanted to know… Or at least Ingus's unit, um…

[GM] 22:49:45
Canyon-heavy Market. Wanted to know where she was.

[Ink] 22:49:49
Gotcha. Um, we're pretty new to this station, I wanted to tell her, I guess, and uh… We are interested in what you would let us know about the resistance.

[Ink] 22:50:00
If that's something we can speak about. What's your… what's your intention, I guess.

[Ink] 22:50:05
We may be interested in supporting it beyond just giving you guys oxygen.

[GM] 22:50:06
Um…

[GM] 22:50:12
Honestly, the people here, if they could just breathe and live.

[GM] 22:50:16
Without worry about having to pay a debt. Always.

[GM] 22:50:21
That would be good enough. There'd be no need for violence if we could just all.

[GM] 22:50:26
Just live our lives. Um… but…

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:31
GM, sidebar. Our only thing…

[GM] 22:50:33
Yep.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:37
That we had to do for… Ingus was, just to make contact with her?

[GM] 22:50:42
You just need to find her, yeah. Okay.

[Ink] 22:50:44
Then we get 10K.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:47
Well, we found her!

[GM] 22:50:51
You're gonna run out of the conversation, right? Just like, let's see, uh… Uh, I guess probably they would have been like, here, you know, they probably would have given you, like, some sort of really tiny tracker or something.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:50:54
There are… no air for you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:50:54
I mean, how do we… how do we prove that we found, I guess? How do we show Ingus, I guess?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:05
Oh, okay. Gotcha. I see, I see, I see, okay.

[GM] 22:51:06
You know, you just gotta slip on her. It doesn't seem like it'd be too hard to do. She's… She's wearing, like, um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:12
But now we're faced with the possibility of providing a lot of people with.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:23
Valuable air.

[Ink] 22:51:23
Someone answer about if she knows anything about the drug trade that's going on in the station.

[GM] 22:51:29
Um, I can speak to that. When you get back from fixing the life support.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:34
Oh, carrot! On a stick!

[Ink] 22:51:39
All right. Let's go fix the oxygen station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:42
All right, well, tell us more, like, why hasn't this been done yet?

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:45
Who's… who's guarding it, and why… is it dangerous? What's going on?

[GM] 22:51:49
Yeah, it's dangerous. Um… I don't know what to believe.

[Murderbot V2] 22:51:50
What are you telling us? Why?

[GM] 22:51:56
They… they say that there's a monster. In the place.

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:00
Monster? Like…

[Dex Miro] 22:52:02
In the workplace. Oh, okay.

[GM] 22:52:03
In the life support system.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:52:06
Don't worry, we'll shoot it with our guns. We never miss.

[Ink] 22:52:10
Yeah. Then we draw… I draw a picture with chalk on the floor, right? You know, of a carc. Does it look like this?

[Ink] 22:52:15
I don't do that.

[GM] 22:52:16
She's like, I don't know what that is. And I… Uh, and, you know…

[Murderbot V2] 22:52:19
I don't know what that is.

[GM] 22:52:23
It's hard… it's dark down here, you know, it could just be some… you know, sometimes Tempest Company comes down here and they just use us for target practice.

[GM] 22:52:32
You know, it could be, uh… you know, just… people playing tricks, but I…

[GM] 22:52:39
I don't know. There… there are things down here that don't make sense.

[GM] 22:52:44
Um.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:44
Wait, so when you say the. The team recently left.

[Dex Miro] 22:52:49
Do you mean the monster killed them?

[GM] 22:52:54
They should have returned by now. And… yes, there's probably a good chance that something happened to them.

[GM] 22:53:01
They may not be fully dead, but, you know, I would have expected them to have returned not that long ago.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:14
So what can you tell us about this monster?

[GM] 22:53:16
Nothing. I don't even know if there is a monster. It's also possible that they… took this equipment, sold it in the black market, made enough money to get out of Doptown.

[GM] 22:53:28
These… I mean, I trust these people. I don't think that's what happened, but.

[Dex Miro] 22:53:28
Those jerks.

[GM] 22:53:32
Could the Tempest Company be waiting for it? Like, you know, I don't.

[GM] 22:53:37
Why they'd have to kick us when we're down, but they could be, you know, just trying to prevent us from actually getting.

[GM] 22:53:42
The ability to breathe. You notice when she says that, that, like, she doesn't seem to struggle, like, other people struggle to breathe.

[Murderbot V2] 22:53:53
Oh, she's got gills all over her body.

[Ink] 22:53:57
Can I ask her why she doesn't seem to have a problem breathing?

[GM] 22:53:58
Here. Uh, she takes her scarf and kind of pulls it down. You do see, in fact, that she does have these gills.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:06
Oh my god! Oh, dear God!

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:14
What was wrong with you? You didn't get that look, that lady!

[Ink] 22:54:27
Alright, let's roll out. Let's go.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:27
It's up to you guys, I do what Carnoc tells me.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:33
I feel like we've done our job. We stick the AirTag on her and get… get out of here, but, you know…

[Ink] 22:54:33
Let's go fix this station.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:43
It's up to you. Interviews?

[Ink] 22:54:43
Shut up.

[Dex Miro] 22:54:44
Oh, yeah? Where do you put the AirTag?

[Dex Miro] 22:54:49
Really? She's not gonna feel that.

[Ink] 22:54:51
Now, everybody knows there's no nerve endings in those.

[Murderbot V2] 22:54:53
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I mean, we just drop it in the office that we're sitting here with. You know, whatever.

[GM] 22:54:56
She's wearing, kind of, like…

[Ink] 22:54:59
You've got one of those, like, heavy cloak things on, you know, like all nomadic, like, leaders do.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:03
Yeah, yeah, she's… You can pin it on her somewhere, you know.

[GM] 22:55:04
Yeah, yeah, she definitely has a heavy cloak. If you just, like, flicked it at, it'll probably, like, fall into, like, a… like a bolt of her clothing. You… it'd be pretty easy to get it onto her.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:13
Not good.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:15
That's my suggestion. I think this is what we… we should just go back and collect our… and we can get my Kai, and we can collect our money.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:23
Zeke, I mean, you wanna go do this work? We can just go back and, you know, get you some drugs.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:55:30
Well, they wanted the drug so I could figure out where the drugs were coming from, but I think this is a more valuable mission.

[Murderbot V2] 22:55:36
Why? We don't gain anything about the drug trade from this, do we?

[Ink] 22:55:36
Yeah, I think just as a… Her as an ally, it seems, you know, like a good thing, and uh… looking at our larger mission, yeah.

[Ink] 22:55:45
And plus, like, if, you know, if it's such an easy mission, we walked right down here and found her.

[Ink] 22:55:50
Um, I don't think we're returning very easily.

[Dex Miro] 22:55:54
So, uh, how much air do we bring with us?

[GM] 22:55:56
12 hours worth. You spend probably about an hour.

[Dex Miro] 22:56:01
Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:02
But it's 4 hours there and 4 hours back. I don't know if I can fix the thing in…

[Dex Miro] 22:56:05
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:56:08
I don't know if I can fix the thing at all. Never mind then.

[Ink] 22:56:08
Oh. Can I ask her, how do you get a set of those gills? Is that something you're born with?

[GM] 22:56:13
There's a doctor down here. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:16
Oh, uh, a, uh, a modified… not a modifier.

[GM] 22:56:21
Yeah, but it's different, it's… um… he says he's a geneticist, and that…

[GM] 22:56:27
Somehow it just modifies your genes in order to… grow these things.

[Murderbot V2] 22:56:33
Oh, no, this is the… it's the… it's the… it's the, uh… the polywog juice from Harry Potter, or something.

[GM] 22:56:34
Um…

[GM] 22:56:43
His name is Dr. Bunkali, um… I think, you know, he's been trying to help.

[GM] 22:56:48
People by giving them these gills, but… It doesn't work for everybody. It doesn't take for everybody.

[GM] 22:56:55
That's why we still need to fix the… Fix the error.

[Ink] 22:57:05
As we go fix the air?

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:09
Yeah, I'll go fix the air for ya.

[Dex Miro] 22:57:13
I mean, I don't know if we can fix it, but let's have a look.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:19
Alright! Carnoc, is that what you want to do?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:57:24
Yeah, I guess so.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:26
All right!

[Zeke Sinclair] 22:57:28
Hey, Carnoc, can you transfer control of MotorBot to Zeke just for a bit? Just for…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:57:32
No.

[Murderbot V2] 22:57:32
That's against company protocol.

[Ink] 22:57:33
Don't do that, he's gonna try to plug into and upload himself into his…

[Dex Miro] 22:57:38
Nonsense, it's not like he has a history of that.

[GM] 22:57:44
Um… All right, well, good luck.

[GM] 22:57:50
Um, I don't… I don't believe in monsters, but, you know, hopefully… Yeah, so hopefully there's nothing to be afraid of. Hopefully those guys were just assholes, and…

[GM] 22:57:59
They're taking their time or something.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:04
Give me a goddamn gun.

[Ink] 22:58:07
Did you bring your gun?

[Dex Miro] 22:58:08
Don't… don't we… didn't we all bring one? Isn't that why we went to the show?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 22:58:08
Don't you have one?

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:09
Oh, did I bring a gun with me? Yeah. Okay, never mind, I brought a gun with me.

[Murderbot V2] 22:58:14
Let's go.

[GM] 22:58:16
Alright, you head out towards… the life support system.

[GM] 22:58:39
Uh…

[GM] 22:58:46
Okay. Okay.

[GM] 22:58:51
Oops.

[GM] 22:58:57
Okay. Um…

[GM] 22:59:10
You're about an hour or two, probably closer to. Yeah, you're an hour out from DOPTown.

[GM] 22:59:17
Uh, you're walking along the… slums of mostly, like, disappeared. It's pretty sporadic where you'll see people.

[GM] 22:59:26
Um, though you do see plenty of. Just bodies. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:32
Dead? Not moving?

[GM] 22:59:32
Dead. Um… Not… not moving.

[GM] 22:59:37
Um. You, uh, round a corner, um…

[Ink] 22:59:38
They look lovely

[GM] 22:59:43
And, uh, you see… Three guys sitting, uh…

[GM] 22:59:49
Across, like… the… the street, or whatever, they're… they're… they're impeding your path.

[GM] 22:59:56
They're wielding spears. Uh, and then two guys appear behind you.

[Murderbot V2] 22:59:59
What the fuck?

[Dex Miro] 23:00:00
What?

[GM] 23:00:03
Also having spirits, and they're like… Hey. You got…

[GM] 23:00:08
You got oxygen?

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:11
Leave us alone, we're trying to get you all the oxygen you can breathe!

[GM] 23:00:15
How are you gonna do that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:16
We're trying to fix the regulator!

[GM] 23:00:21
Yeah, we just ran into some guys. Two, that said they were doing that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:25
And what'd you do to them? Yeah?

[GM] 23:00:28
Well, that's one of them over there, and you see a guy who… clearly has been pierced by spears.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:34
Oh, fuck. What'd you do that for?

[GM] 23:00:39
Because they didn't want to give us their O2 tanks. Yeah. Easy excuse.

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:43
But he was trying to save your lives!

[Murderbot V2] 23:00:51
Listen, you either let us go, or we're gonna shoot you all to death.

[Ink] 23:00:55
Uh, I'd really like to see Carnoc. Is target practice?

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:02
You… you are either gonna be riddled with holes, bullet holes, or you let us through and help you.

[Ink] 23:01:06
Just everybody stand behind Carnoc or something, I don't know how this could go anyway.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:11
How many people? Five of them. With spears.

[GM] 23:01:13
There are 5 of them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:19
And… how many of us. With what?

[GM] 23:01:21
There's five of you. Full struggles.

[Dex Miro] 23:01:25
Pulse rifles.

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:25
Okay, alright. Hey, buddy!

[GM] 23:01:34
Um…

[GM] 23:01:40
Let's see…

[Ink] 23:01:42
Is there one that seems like the leader?

[Murderbot V2] 23:01:45
The one probably talking to us.

[GM] 23:01:46
Yeah, there definitely seems to be one that sort of… the other… Most of them do seem sort of on the.

[GM] 23:01:52
On the fence about what… what they're proposing. The one guy does seem, you know, to have an air of desperation around him, that…

[GM] 23:02:02
He would, uh… he might feel like…

[GM] 23:02:09
Making a… making an attempt to… to do something. Um.

[GM] 23:02:16
So you're trying to intimidate them? Okay, it works. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:02:19
Yeah. Okay.

[GM] 23:02:23
As soon as one of them breaks, uh, the rest easily fold. Uh, even the guy who seemed a bit desperate.

[GM] 23:02:31
Um, runs off as well.

[GM] 23:02:37
And you continue on your way.

[Ink] 23:02:40
That's right.

[GM] 23:02:46
Um…

[GM] 23:03:02
Where are they?

[GM] 23:03:25
35…

[GM] 23:03:32
Okay, as you're walking along, again… Oh. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:03:42
Oh?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:03:43
I feel like I should be on a survival pit.

[GM] 23:03:44
Um…

[Ink] 23:03:53
I don't know if 10s or 1s are good, but neither one… both of them can't be good.

[GM] 23:03:57
Oh, God! You're walking along. Okay, so you're walking, um…

[GM] 23:04:03
Another hour or so passes, uh, and… you… you know, like I said, there's… there's bodies just sort of everywhere.

[GM] 23:04:13
Um… you hear, like, some crying… as if, like, a child.

[GM] 23:04:20
Um… And you look to see where it's coming from, and you see a child sort of laying face down on the ground.

[GM] 23:04:30
Um… And you hear this crying noise, but the… the…

[GM] 23:04:36
Child isn't moving at all. It's just sort of laying there.

[GM] 23:04:43
Um… you hear some scuffling off to your right, and you see just sort of the flash.

[GM] 23:04:51
Uh, like, just barely catch the image of another child. Um, but something's wrong with it.

[GM] 23:04:57
It's like hair, you know, and sort of, like, it's, uh… isn't laying flat against its head, like, it has some sort of bulge on its forehead.

[GM] 23:05:08
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:10
I silently aimed my gun at it.

[GM] 23:05:13
At the one that's on the ground, or the one that just… you caught just a glimpse of?

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:17
Don't want the bulge.

[GM] 23:05:18
Okay. It's… it's probably hiding behind something at this moment.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:23
That's fine. As soon as it moves, I might either shoot it, or just… not shoot it, but it's in that direction.

[GM] 23:05:29
Yeah. You hear more of this, uh, like.

[GM] 23:05:35
Scattering around you. Feet… like…

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:37
Oh, my fuck.

[GM] 23:05:41
Gonna slap the feet on, like, hard stone or metal. Um… And then, uh…

[GM] 23:05:48
Your attention's drawn back to the, uh… the child that's laying on the ground, because you hear it say.

[GM] 23:05:57
Kill me! And then it snaps his head… snaps its head around, looks at you, and it's like.

[Murderbot V2] 23:05:58
Oh my god!

[GM] 23:06:03
Faces mutated and just… like, its jaw is shrunken, but its teeth are sort of…

[GM] 23:06:09
Like, has this awful overbite. Uh, and it pushes itself up off the ground in an unnatural way and starts running at you.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:06:18
Jesus.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:22
What kind of crazy horror movie have we gotten ourselves into here?

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:27
Um, it's… it doesn't have any weapons or anything on it, right?

[Ink] 23:06:28
Craig Carnoc.

[GM] 23:06:30
It doesn't have any weapons, but it's coming at you like it's going to kill you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:31
Who is it running at first?

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:36
Who's the closest? Who is it running at? Okay.

[GM] 23:06:39
Uh, clearly you.

[Dex Miro] 23:06:41
I mean, this is just a kid, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:42
It's a little child, yeah? The size of a little child.

[GM] 23:06:45
It's… it's a… it's a disfigured human child. Well, you definitely see teeth, because of this weird overbite, um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:06:48
Do I see claws or teeth, or anything like that?

[GM] 23:06:55
But it's running fast at you, and… In a way where it looks like it intends to hurt you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:02
Can I try to, like, with the butt of the gun, like… knock it out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:08
Smackin' on the head?

[GM] 23:07:09
Um… First, you have to… everyone needs to make a sanity save.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:13
Oh, jeez.

[GM] 23:07:15
Because you have to make a sandy save for each round, it begs you to kill it.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:15
Yeah, that checks out.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:20
I mean, we hear that all the time. Oh, no!

[Dex Miro] 23:07:22
I'll let it go all.

[GM] 23:07:24
All the time.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:28
Yeah. All right.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:29
Oh, no!

[Ink] 23:07:31
Nice, Carnoc.

[Dex Miro] 23:07:33
Yeah.

[GM] 23:07:33
There's no… no critical fails yet.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:07:35
Do failing sanity checks do… stress, or no? They do? Okay.

[GM] 23:07:38
Yeah, yeah, so everyone who failed, uh, took a point of stress.

[Murderbot V2] 23:07:44
I don't know why I get stressed at this. I'm about to knock this fucking thing out.

[GM] 23:07:48
Um…

[GM] 23:07:54
Alright, so you wait to butt it with your gun, um… Go ahead and roll a combat check.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:02
Uh, you know I'm not good at combat. Damn it. I guess it's better than taking a shot, because it's probably, like, I would aim wildly and hit Carnoc in the face or something.

[GM] 23:08:10
Okay. Uh, no, do you… do you…

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:17
Fuck! I miss…

[GM] 23:08:23
Ready up, your attention's fully on this thing, you slam your… the butt of the gun into its head.

[GM] 23:08:29
Uh, caving in its forehead. Blood spatters up onto you.

[GM] 23:08:34
But what you didn't see was the child that crawled up onto the roof next to you and leaps down and.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:34
Oh my god!

[GM] 23:08:39
Is on your neck now.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:08:42
That's what you mean you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:43
Do I do another check, or, uh… Strength check to throw it off of me?

[GM] 23:08:48
Uh, no, no, it's, it's no. Attempting to, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:08:51
Oh, uh… bite me?

[GM] 23:08:54
To hurt you. Uh, it does not. It's like…

[GM] 23:09:00
Clawing and hitting at you, but it… it's just got child fingers.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:04
Yeah. Can I throw it off me now?

[GM] 23:09:09
Uh… nope, because, uh… 8 more of these…

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:11
Oh. 70 other morphs?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:09:16
8 mower.

[GM] 23:09:16
Ain't more of these children are… coming out of the darkness, all hideously disfigured.

[GM] 23:09:25
Um…

[Ink] 23:09:27
Okay, I'm… I'm gonna start shooting.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:30
Shit, I just wanna… I didn't know I was gonna cave it in! I thought… I just wanted to knock it out!

[Ink] 23:09:34
Alright, I'm gonna shoot at the… into the darkness at some of the things, hoping to scare something away.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:39
GM, how did I cave it in? Okay, never mind. Alright, I just don't know my own strength.

[Ink] 23:09:43
Right, what do I do? Not shooting anywhere near anybody in the team.

[GM] 23:09:44
Uh, do a combat check.

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:46
Oh, no…

[Murderbot V2] 23:09:51
The gun slipped, the handle slips out!

[Ink] 23:09:55
All right, yeah, I, like, yeah. To hit the ceiling, apparently, spot, and IGC.

[GM] 23:09:58
Okay. Alright, yeah, you, you…

[GM] 23:10:04
Oh, do you shout anything? You're like, let's rock or something? I don't know.

[Ink] 23:10:08
Get the fuck outta here!

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:10
Let's rock!

[GM] 23:10:12
All right, you… you, like, just… unleash, you're just… back and forth, like, you know, you kill at least, like, 4 kids, uh…

[Ink] 23:10:22
Oh, yeah.

[GM] 23:10:24
And you run out of ammo. Uh.

[GM] 23:10:29
Now, I mean, not permanently, but you, like, you're out of that magazine, I don't… Yeah. Um…

[Ink] 23:10:32
I gotta reload, yeah.

[GM] 23:10:35
It does not seem to deter them in any way. Everyone gained one stress.

[Ink] 23:10:39
Okay.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:41
But there's even more now.

[GM] 23:10:43
Uh, no, there's still… there's only 5… well, there's… yeah, there's 5 remaining, one of them on Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 23:10:48
Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:10:56
I mean, don't shoot me!

[Dex Miro] 23:11:02
But we gain another stress, huh?

[Ink] 23:11:03
No, we're not shooting you. I killed 4 of them, somebody else can do something now. I gotta reload, I'm reloading.

[Murderbot V2] 23:11:05
Nice. Well done. Good job, you. I still have one on me.

[Ink] 23:11:10
And I'm watching for children so they don't jump off top of things on me.

[Ink] 23:11:16
I'm gonna put my back up against Carnoc's back.

[Ink] 23:11:22
Hey, buddy, let's see some of that sharpshooting. I hear about.

[Ink] 23:11:28
Carnoc? Hey.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:11:30
Uh, sure. I mean, I could. Well, I was gonna… I was thinking about helping Murderbot.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:11:36
But I could shoot the… I could shoot the other four if someone else wants to help MurderPod.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:45
Let's see if I can, like… Probably the one-off Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:50
Well, how is… is it, like, just totally grabbing around his neck or something?

[GM] 23:11:53
Yeah, yeah. He doesn't seem totally fazed by it, because obviously he's a murder bot, but like… Right. It doesn't seem like there's any immediate danger, but yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:11:58
Right, he can still breathe, because he doesn't have to breathe.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:06
I mean, I'm pretty sure probably the next time I could just throw this thing off of me.

[GM] 23:12:11
So, you're… you're trying to pull the kid off? Alright, uh, make a strength.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:12
Don't shoot your eye out. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:12:14
Huh?

[GM] 23:12:18
Is it string save, string check? I don't know.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:19
Doesn't sound like something I'm good at, but… Sure, let's do it.

[GM] 23:12:31
Okay. Yeah, do you grab onto it, um… And, yeah, you get another stress.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:31
Nope, not good at it. Oh, I get another stress note.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:37
Why you shouldn't do things.

[GM] 23:12:39
Uh, you… you rip it off of him, only its arms are still attached to his neck.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:45
Oh, no…

[GM] 23:12:45
Uh, and in the thing's screaming, KILL ME! Um… Which everyone has to make another sanity safe.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:12:53
Oh my goodness.

[Dex Miro] 23:12:55
You're good. Uh-oh.

[Ink] 23:13:01
Oh, no… I'm just going insane, too.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:03
Critical fail decks.

[Ink] 23:13:07
How would I do row 296s in a row? In my role this 96, something's wrong.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:13:11
Aww

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:13:13
Yeah, odds are not good.

[Ink] 23:13:15
Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:15
Wait, what am I rolling sanity again? Me too?

[GM] 23:13:17
Yeah, same to you, too. So, Ink, uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:23
Oh, dear God.

[GM] 23:13:23
Normally in a clip, you have three. Shots, effectively, for a pulse rifle, so that's… that was sort of, like, the downside, just to give you a sense of…

[Ink] 23:13:32
Okay.

[GM] 23:13:33
Why that failure was still successful, but also did have a drawback to it.

[GM] 23:13:37
Right, so for most everybody, um… Except for, uh, Murderbot.

[GM] 23:13:44
Uh, take a stress point.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:44
And the one with the… with the kid on me, and I'm… I'm saying.

[Dex Miro] 23:13:48
But so, yet another stress down? Okay. I'm already up to 8.

[GM] 23:13:51
Yeah, yet another stress. It's just accumulating so quickly here. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:13:57
Why did we decide to do this, people?

[GM] 23:13:57
Um… You still… you have a pair of arms that are still trying to strangle you right now.

[Murderbot V2] 23:14:03
I just wanted to throw an AirTag on her.

[Dex Miro] 23:14:05
I mean, it's hard for them to get any leverage if they're not attached to anything, so he's probably fine.

[GM] 23:14:07
No, he doesn't seem an immediate threat. Um, alright, what happens to decks?

[Dex Miro] 23:14:11
Like, in a completely unusable way, or a… Okay.

[GM] 23:14:16
Um…

[GM] 23:14:23
Uh…

[GM] 23:14:36
Dexter's so freaked out. By this thing screaming, kill me, you take your… your gun and you just…

[GM] 23:14:43
Throw it, hoping to kill the kid. With your gun. Um…

[GM] 23:14:52
It smashes into the child, killing it, but also, like. Damages your weapon.

[GM] 23:15:08
It could probably be repaired, but… you know, you'd have to have tools to be able to do that.

[GM] 23:15:16
Carnoc and Zeke?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:15:19
I'll take a shot at the other 4, I guess.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:15:30
How's this weekend? Yeah.

[GM] 23:15:40
Uh, likewise, similar to, uh… similar to DEX, uh, you unload your entire clip.

[Dex Miro] 23:15:40
You mean similar to ink?

[GM] 23:15:47
You kill all of them, but uh… Yeah, you're… you run out of ammo, or at least.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:15:52
Okay.

[GM] 23:15:52
You know, for now. Oh, sorry, yes.

[GM] 23:15:59
Oh, wait. Was it… I thought it was… Oh, ducks… oh, sorry.

[GM] 23:16:03
Dex, oh, I thought Ink had done the critical fail. Ink, you're gun is fine. You didn't do that.

[Ink] 23:16:12
Yeah.

[GM] 23:16:13
I forgot that Dex was Dex. You grab this kid, uh, and… what does it do?

[GM] 23:16:22
Um…

[GM] 23:16:29
Got no arms.

[GM] 23:16:36
Yeah, make a panic check.

[Dex Miro] 23:16:44
Um, there's no button for that, because I haven't added it yet, so I just roll the D100 when it…

[Murderbot V2] 23:16:45
Bless you.

[Ink] 23:16:45
Oh.

[GM] 23:16:49
D20. This is the only time the D20 comes into play.

[GM] 23:16:54
All right. 2…

[GM] 23:17:02
Gain 1 stress.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:05
Sure. Okay. When does stress get really bad?

[GM] 23:17:13
Uh, the… the… child sort of asking for death, you quickly snap its neck, but…

[GM] 23:17:20
Uh, you know, this has caused you a lot of anxiety.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:25
Okay, so the… my gun isn't damaged, but I'm scarred. Mentally.

[GM] 23:17:28
No, no, no, no, I totally misinterpreted… I thought Ink was the one that failed to say, like, critically failed, um, and so I just had him sort of… act out rashly.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:40
Okay.

[GM] 23:17:40
But you… you kill that child, but it comes at a mental toll.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:46
Yeah, I get that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:17:48
Not me.

[Dex Miro] 23:17:51
So what… sorry, what happened when Carnoc shot at the other four?

[GM] 23:17:54
He killed them all. He just ran out of ammo.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:00
Like, just finished his magazine, totally out, right?

[GM] 23:18:02
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not like he, like, reloaded and kept firing and stuff, no, it's just…

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:03
I give Zeke… I give my, uh, full magazine to Carnoc in exchange for his empty one.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:18:15
Bye. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:16
Because you're a better shot than I am.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:30
Is the thing off of me yet? Did I throw it?

[GM] 23:18:31
Yeah, yeah, no, the two arms fall all to the ground.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:33
So that's a rough life down here.

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:36
Oh, Jesus. Christ. Alright, so do we keep moving forward, or do we go backwards? What do you guys want to do? Who's… who is empty right now?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:46
Ink? Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on, how would… do we have extra ammo, then?

[Ink] 23:18:47
I have to reload.

[Ink] 23:18:52
I just emptied a clip.

[Dex Miro] 23:18:54
Oh, dear God, you actually got into make images of this?

[Murderbot V2] 23:18:54
Oh, just a clip. That's not… this isn't all the ammo we have.

[Ink] 23:18:58
It was really hard to get it to do it. I had to tell it as a Chucky doll.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:01
We have extra clips, GM?

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:08
Hello? Oh, we have extra cups? Never mind, give me back my ammo, Carnoc!

[GM] 23:19:09
Um, yes, there… I mean, I don't know how much you're carrying, we can…

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:16
I don't either. Like, what is the… do we… Does everybody have, like…

[GM] 23:19:17
We can make an assumption about how much you're carrying.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:22
5 clips or something? I don't know.

[GM] 23:19:27
Ammo is usually 50 credits. Per magazine.

[GM] 23:19:31
So, however much you want to spend right now is however many clips, uh, although… I don't know if you recall, last time I… made mention of, um, having, uh.

[GM] 23:19:41
So many small, medium, and large items on your person. So, uh, an ammo clip would be a small item, so you probably can't carry.

[Dex Miro] 23:19:45
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 23:19:50
You can't easily carry more than 4.

[Murderbot V2] 23:19:57
I will carry… two clips.

[GM] 23:20:00
Okay. Uh, 50 credits.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:03
Wait, how much? End of clip.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:06
Oh, I can only afford one clip, never mind. I'm now down to 20 credits, I guess.

[GM] 23:20:09
Okay. There we go.

[GM] 23:20:14
Okay, you continue on your way. You get to… Life support thingy.

[GM] 23:20:23
Um… It's kind of easy to distinguish what it is, uh, you know, it stands out amongst all the other buildings around it.

[GM] 23:20:33
Oh, how we doing on time? Just wanted to check in real quick.

[Ink] 23:20:36
1120, right? Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:37
1220.

[GM] 23:20:39
Yeah. Do you guys want to play till 12, or should I… So I want to stop.

[Ink] 23:20:43
Awesome, that's what I was planning on.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:20:44
I don't want to play past 12, but I'm okay with 12.

[GM] 23:20:44
Okay. Okay.

[Murderbot V2] 23:20:49
Must be nice.

[GM] 23:20:50
Um… Alright, so you see this… this larger building, um…

[GM] 23:20:57
It has… it's, you know, a glow with light, um… Not super bright, but, like, clearly stands out, like, this is a building that…

[GM] 23:21:06
Um, is of primary importance. Um, you're pretty sure, just by looking at that this is the… life support, uh, system.

[GM] 23:21:16
Um, you can hear… machinery running, um…

[GM] 23:21:23
And as you approach it, you see, uh, at the front, massive cracked door.

[GM] 23:21:29
Um, it's encrusted with cables and wires. Uh, that look like… almost as if they were, like, veins spreading across the doors.

[GM] 23:21:38
Um, as much as you can… you attempt to, like, it's way too heavy to open. You'll need to find a different… a different way in.

[Dex Miro] 23:21:49
With, like, the wires, like, ugh. Hold the door shut.

[GM] 23:21:53
Uh, no. Uh, they just kind of look like… They're… it's more aesthetic than it is, like…

[Dex Miro] 23:21:58
Okay.

[GM] 23:21:59
It's also just weird. Why are there so many wires, sort of… Bolting across this door.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:22:05
Are we in, like, a… oh my god. How would there be another way? Are we in, like, a hallway?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:22:11
Right?

[GM] 23:22:12
Uh, I mean, it's almost as if, like, this area being down in the… the, um, choke, it's almost like… Cavernous, like, you can't actually, like, easily see, like, the ceiling of this place.

[GM] 23:22:25
Um, and so it almost has this feeling of being, like, outside.

[GM] 23:22:32
So this building in and of itself is probably, what. Two, three stories tall.

[GM] 23:22:38
Um… And it's, uh… it's not… you know, it's not huge, insofar as that it's, like.

[GM] 23:22:45
The base of it, to walk her all the way around it, probably only takes, like.

[GM] 23:22:50
5 minutes, 10 minutes at most? Um.

[GM] 23:22:56
So, I don't know if that gives you a sense of, like.

[GM] 23:22:59
What the environment looks like. Okay.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:23:01
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:23:10
Okay. Well, should we walk around and see if we can see another wave in, then?

[Ink] 23:23:15
Good.

[GM] 23:23:18
Okay. You spend some time, uh, walking around, uh, you eventually find a small cracked entrance.

[Murderbot V2] 23:23:18
You're

[GM] 23:23:29
Marked EST-03. Um, Zeke.

[GM] 23:23:36
Because he knows things about life support, obviously. Uh, tells you that EST stands for environmental scrubbing Tower.

[GM] 23:23:47
So, you know this is the place you're supposed to be. Um… And there's a hole gouged in the side of the building.

[GM] 23:23:55
Um…

[GM] 23:24:01
The hole, though, is small. You suspect that maybe, um… whatever other team, you know, because you haven't really seen.

[GM] 23:24:08
That other group of people, you did see the one person who was dead, but… Um, you imagine that they probably used this to get into the building.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:19
So it's big enough for a person to squeeze through, but not much more.

[GM] 23:24:22
Yeah, but with your… if you're wearing a hazard suit. Um, it actually… you probably won't be able to squeeze in there.

[GM] 23:24:30
Um, it's pretty tight.

[Ink] 23:24:32
But take our hesitate off, put it through the hole, and then… go through, and put it on the other side.

[GM] 23:24:36
Sure. Yeah, you could do that.

[Ink] 23:24:39
Right. Murder by your own first.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:39
What happened now? What?

[Dex Miro] 23:24:44
That's what I heard.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:24:46
I heard that, too.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:46
Through… through the door? I can fit through it?

[Ink] 23:24:47
Yeah, through the crack. Yep.

[Dex Miro] 23:24:52
Definitely not a sphincter, but… Pretty close.

[Murderbot V2] 23:24:55
Okay. All right.

[GM] 23:24:56
Not a sphincter. Um, okay.

[GM] 23:25:02
You go through… The, quote, hidden entrance.

[GM] 23:25:07
Um… It's not far, you know, like, this is, you know, it's pretty much…

[GM] 23:25:15
The wall's not very thick, there's no reason for it to be very thick, so it only takes you… The undressing and the redressing part are the parts that take the longest.

[GM] 23:25:24
Um… You got… you have, like, maybe a moment where you're not hooked up to your oxygen, and you realize just how hard it is actually to breathe down here.

[GM] 23:25:35
Like, your lungs strain to just feel like you're getting any kind of air inside of them.

[GM] 23:25:42
Um, and if you… Maybe by the time you put… you're putting your hazard suit back on, they start to burn just from the strain of trying to…

[GM] 23:25:51
Uptake oxygen. Um, it almost feels like you're drowning.

[GM] 23:25:59
Uh…

[Dex Miro] 23:26:00
Sucks down here. Why do we come here?

[Murderbot V2] 23:26:03
I don't know! I told you guys that we did our job, let's get back and collect the 10K!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:26:08
Murderbot, you don't need air, you just don't understand.

[GM] 23:26:14
Um… you get inside and… Unlike outside, there's no light inside here.

[GM] 23:26:20
Um, you turn on your flashlights, uh. That are built into your suits.

[GM] 23:26:25
And you can see, but, like, uh, so the machinery is running on the inside, but clearly this thing is not up to full power.

[GM] 23:26:33
Um, whatever's… Running is probably barely running, and so… Um, yeah.

[GM] 23:26:41
Um…

[GM] 23:26:46
It's so hard to read sometimes. Alright, it looks like…

[GM] 23:26:52
Uh, you walk through… the area… it doesn't look to be too heavily damaged.

[GM] 23:27:00
Um… And you get to an area called the control rooms.

[GM] 23:27:08
Um… There's a number of terminal banks.

[GM] 23:27:14
Um…

[GM] 23:27:18
You know, they're just… but they're all… more or less powered down.

[GM] 23:27:24
Um, nearby, though, there's a rusty and crumbling stair. Staircase.

[GM] 23:27:31
Um… it looks like, though, if you're to get this place up and running, you're gonna have to go up.

[Ink] 23:27:41
Let's go up!

[GM] 23:27:44
Yeah.

[GM] 23:27:52
Does traverse the middle staircase, um, but you get the sense that, like.

[GM] 23:27:57
It kind of groans under your weight, so you go sort of one at a time.

[GM] 23:28:01
Um… You get up to the next level.

[GM] 23:28:06
Uh, and there's, like, a… a doorway, uh, which you're able to pry open, um, and above the doorway is written, processing plant.

[GM] 23:28:16
Um… It's a little bit quieter in here because you think this is where, just, like, the scrubbers are.

[GM] 23:28:25
Whereas down below is probably, like, the pumps and, like, the, um… basically just the way air is forced out into the atmosphere.

[GM] 23:28:35
Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:28:40
Mostly come out at night, mostly.

[GM] 23:28:48
Okay. There's… a stairway up yet to the third level.

[GM] 23:28:54
Um, and then there's also…

[GM] 23:29:04
Okay. There's also another room adjacent to the processing plant.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:16
I go into the room. Gun drawn.

[GM] 23:29:20
Okay. Um…

[GM] 23:29:29
You open it up. Inside… you see… Um…

[GM] 23:29:37
Three bloodless corpses. It looked like as if they'd been, like, sucked dry. Their skin is, like.

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:39
Oh, Jesus.

[GM] 23:29:44
Plastered against their skeleton. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:29:46
Oh, boy.

[GM] 23:29:50
There is a… stash of pulse rifle ammunition and three O2 tanks.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:00
I take another clip. And I give them the thanks to whoever needs them.

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:07
Right now.

[GM] 23:30:09
They contain a total of 19 hours of O2.

[Ink] 23:30:12
Nice. Okay. Do we have any indication of what killed these people?

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:15
Congratulations, you can breathe.

[GM] 23:30:16
Um…

[GM] 23:30:21
You wanna do some, like… Check… of some sort.

[Ink] 23:30:24
I got pathology expert.

[GM] 23:30:28
You don't think it's a disease?

[Murderbot V2] 23:30:30
I do first aid, or take a look with my first aid skills.

[Ink] 23:30:33
I also do have first dates, so yeah, can I analyze them?

[GM] 23:30:36
Sure.

[Ink] 23:30:36
I got maybe some mastery in this. What kind of check is that?

[GM] 23:30:41
I don't know, I thought you said you had first aid.

[Ink] 23:30:43
Well, the first aid check, alright, here we go. It's gonna do attributes, strength.

[GM] 23:30:47
Oh, I guess it'd be like, oh yeah, so you would probably use intelligence?

[Ink] 23:30:50
Yeah, I think that's it.

[GM] 23:30:51
All right. Murderbot does it. Ink does not.

[Ink] 23:30:57
I don't. I don't clue what he's… Cause of death.

[Murderbot V2] 23:31:03
Closet death, they died.

[GM] 23:31:04
Um… Uh, the two of you, like, crouched down next to one of the bodies, um…

[GM] 23:31:12
And you notice that, you know, these guys were not wearing hazard suits, they were wearing just normal clothing.

[GM] 23:31:20
Um. There's a sort of…

[GM] 23:31:26
Bruising across one of their, um… Their necks and their back.

[GM] 23:31:32
Looks like, uh, almost like a… straight line that's about an inch thick.

[Ink] 23:31:38
It could have been done by the small hands of a child?

[GM] 23:31:38
Um, that, like. No, it's long, it's like, um…

[GM] 23:31:44
So the… the sh… inch-thick line runs for probably about…

[GM] 23:31:50
Almost a foot across the neck and the back. Um, and then…

[GM] 23:31:56
You'll also notice on all three. Uh, that there's, um…

[GM] 23:32:03
Effectively, four puncture wounds somewhere on the body. It's not always near the neck.

[GM] 23:32:09
Um… there's no… but they're always close to, like, an artery.

[Ink] 23:32:15
Like, getting here by spears, like the other dudes might have?

[GM] 23:32:18
No, they're small.

[Dex Miro] 23:32:19
No. Like, vampire teeth, which is why they were built this.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:23
Oh, no! Fucking vampires…

[Ink] 23:32:25
Vampires here…

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:33
I do a quick scan of the room. See if my computer… Android brain can pick up any movement or anything.

[GM] 23:32:40
Yeah, as you scan, you see the thing… dropping down onto, uh, Ink's character, because he failed to save.

[GM] 23:32:49
It's got… Uh, Six Arms.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:32:54
Oh, boy.

[Ink] 23:32:54
Last time I tried to check for anything.

[Murderbot V2] 23:32:55
Six arms?

[GM] 23:32:55
And it's fault… yeah, falling down upon Ink's character, uh… It tries to…

[GM] 23:33:09
He chose not to check. Um…

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:13
It's on, Ink? It's on ink?

[GM] 23:33:15
Yeah, it's trying to. Basically grapple him and pick him up and take him away.

[GM] 23:33:23
It picks them up, and it starts running with him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:25
But that… it's that strong?

[GM] 23:33:28
It's got 6 arms! At least two of them are beefy.

[Ink] 23:33:28
He's got 6 arms!

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:31
Jeez. Jeez. I was about to say, because if I'm… if I'm right next to him…

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:40
And we're observing the… the corpse together. I was gonna say I pick up my gun and po… pointed at the… at the thing's face and shoot it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:33:51
But it's already picked them up. And run.

[GM] 23:33:53
Yeah, it essentially ambushed you guys.

[Ink] 23:33:56
Don't shoot!

[Ink] 23:34:03
I'll be fine!

[GM] 23:34:08
Uh, you're not so sure you'll be fine. This thing has.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:09
Um… doesn't look fine.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:09
Um… yeah, I'm gonna take a shot, because I don't know what else to do.

[GM] 23:34:12
Large, large fangs and such. And it's easily… it's easily cl…

[Ink] 23:34:14
Hey, maybe it's… maybe it's better I just get shot.

[GM] 23:34:18
Climbing up the wall with you. Alright. And that's all…

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:19
Yeah, I'm taking a shot.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:34:21
I'll take a shot, I'll take a shot, it'll be fine.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:25
Oh my god, that killed me! We're gonna kill Ink! Oh, no!

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:34:27
Oh, boy.

[Dex Miro] 23:34:29
The scientist is firing, this is… this has gone wrong.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:34:29
Yeah.

[GM] 23:34:31
Okay. Well, Murderbot definitely said he was taking the shot first.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:33
Uh… Carnoc!

[GM] 23:34:37
Yeah, that's what you said.

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:37
To me? Oh, fuck me. I'm sorry, Ink!

[Ink] 23:34:42
No, I don't. Fuck it, just hit it!

[Ink] 23:34:46
Going after it! Do something! And just tackle it! You're a murder bot!

[Murderbot V2] 23:34:47
What do you want me to do? Alright, I'll go… I'll go… I'll go run and… well, but it's going up the wall!

[GM] 23:34:55
Yeah. Yeah, you see that there's, like, a… not a small hole, there's a hole in the ceiling, um… Going up to the next level that it seems like it's carrying him up into.

[Ink] 23:34:56
Oh, let's not do that, I like that.

[GM] 23:35:06
Uh, you might be able to… if… If you make a speed check and succeed, you might be able to grab onto it before it gets into the hole.

[Dex Miro] 23:35:06
Well, you're an Android, you're heavy, maybe it can't lift both of you.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:14
That's what I'll do.

[GM] 23:35:17
Oh, alright, yeah, you critically succeed. Um, you, you…

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:20
Yes! I just saved Ink's life.

[Ink] 23:35:21
Oh, yeah. Oh, spike it up.

[GM] 23:35:25
You run up there, and you, like, grab onto it, um… Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:27
Where are you going, motherfucker? No, I grab onto the… the thing?

[Dex Miro] 23:35:30
He grabs onto ink or the thing.

[GM] 23:35:34
Yeah. Um… And you yank it down off the wall. It doesn't release ink, but it doesn't look like it's gonna easily get away.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:44
And then I stomp its head in. Oh, damn it!

[GM] 23:35:47
Okay, no, it's not your turn anymore. Alright.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:35:53
I'll defer my shot to Carnoc.

[Murderbot V2] 23:35:55
No, get over here and, like, hold it down so that Carnet can just point-blank shoot it in the face.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:36:03
I'm not gonna hold it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:05
Guys, there's no other choice here. We are horrible, horrible shots. We are going to end up… You're either gonna hit me, or you're gonna hit Ink.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:36:10
That's why I don't want to be in the way.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:17
Maybe it's better to hit me, but you're gonna either hit one of us.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:21
That's for sure. I completely missed the thing, whatever that thing is.

[GM] 23:36:23
Arnett can do it. I'm sure it can do it.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:36:28
Carnoc will try to shoot it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:29
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

[GM] 23:36:30
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, shit!

[Dex Miro] 23:36:34
I mean, if it can get closer first.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:36:39
Yeah…

[GM] 23:36:40
All right, uh… Uh…

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:40
Oh… Nice.

[Ink] 23:36:42
This is gonna be amazing.

[Dex Miro] 23:36:44
Double… double thread, both 11s.

[Murderbot V2] 23:36:45
Boom-boom!

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:36:46
Wow. Well, there's something weird with the rolls today.

[Ink] 23:36:49
I'll never doubt Carnoc again.

[GM] 23:36:52
All right, do, uh, double damage. So, 6010, I think?

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:36:59
60-10? Oh, I don't have a… Post. I haven't SMG, I don't have a pulse rifle.

[GM] 23:37:00
Because I think normally, uh, pulse rifles. What?

[Dex Miro] 23:37:05
Oh, really? We all have Pulse Rifles last mission. What'd you do with yours?

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:07
We all have pulse rifles. You also have an SMG and a pulse driver, which is just…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:37:10
Okay, maybe I…

[Dex Miro] 23:37:13
I think just nobody's touched their equipment list.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:37:17
60, 10, you said?

[GM] 23:37:18
Yep. Okay. Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:37:24
Those are some good D10s.

[Ink] 23:37:27
Those are some nice D10s, wow.

[Dex Miro] 23:37:27
If it's not dead, we're seriously screwed. Okay.

[GM] 23:37:32
It's… It is not dead. It…

[Ink] 23:37:33
Carnoc with the hot dice.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:37:35
Oh, no.

[Murderbot V2] 23:37:37
Oh, no.

[GM] 23:37:38
It screams… Maybe kind of a human, but also a bit inhuman scream.

[GM] 23:37:45
It releases, uh, ink… Um, let's see, what did you…

[GM] 23:37:57
7. Uh… gunshot wound… it starts bleeding profusely from, uh, its chest.

[Ink] 23:38:08
Okay, so now that I'm released, can I put gun to its head, cheat it too?

[GM] 23:38:12
Uh, sure. Nothing can go wrong.

[Ink] 23:38:13
Yeah, nothing go wrong now. Combat check.

[GM] 23:38:18
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:38:18
Yeah, that's my bet.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:38:19
Advantage, right? A compact check with advantage. You're right there.

[Dex Miro] 23:38:20
Does a good advantage, because he's, like, so close to it, he could practically put the gun inside of it.

[GM] 23:38:25
Uh, you're using a pulse rifle? Yeah, it's a bit hard to wield, like, very close.

[Ink] 23:38:27
Yeah.

[GM] 23:38:32
Smg would be.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:38:32
Can you just stab him?

[Ink] 23:38:33
Can I pull out my SMG instead?

[Dex Miro] 23:38:36
Does the Pulse rifle have a bayonet?

[GM] 23:38:39
So many questions. Uh.

[GM] 23:38:42
You could pull out your SMG instead, but, uh, you know… If you fail your shot, you might not even get a shot off, but you might get, you know…

[GM] 23:38:53
Might get stuck in your pants.

[Ink] 23:38:56
Gonna get stuck in my pants?

[GM] 23:38:59
I don't know, I don't know how you're carrying your SMG around.

[Ink] 23:39:02
Alright, well, can I have an advantage with my SMG, at least? I got double chance of not popping up?

[GM] 23:39:06
Sure, sure. Not getting it stuck in your pants, sure.

[Ink] 23:39:09
All right. You wanna get stuck in my pant.

[Dex Miro] 23:39:15
Don't… don't get the pins out of the frank.

[GM] 23:39:15
All right. You, you, you, you pull it out, and you shoot them.

[GM] 23:39:20
You do 2D10.

[Ink] 23:39:23
V10, okay.

[GM] 23:39:29
Oh, 4860, okay. Um…

[GM] 23:39:35
That's… not a second one yet. Okay. Um, Zeke and…

[GM] 23:39:41
Uh, decks. Yep.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:39:44
Everything's still up? Man. Well, yeah, I'll shoot it, what the hell?

[GM] 23:39:49
Hell yeah! Zeke's in on this.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:39:51
It works for everybody. It worked for everybody else, it'll work for the scientist.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:39:54
There you go. Nothing will go wrong.

[Ink] 23:39:56
Can I back away? Oh, damn!

[GM] 23:39:58
No, you're right there.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:39:59
Oh, yeah! Never hit anything before in my life.

[Murderbot V2] 23:40:01
Oh, my God.

[GM] 23:40:04
3d10.

[Ink] 23:40:10
Well, this poor bastard, he didn't know what he's getting into.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:40:13
That's right.

[GM] 23:40:15
Uh, you also, uh… shoot, uh… major hole in its chest. It's not like…

[GM] 23:40:23
Pouring blood out of its chest. Um… what are we at? We're at 60… 75, okay.

[Ink] 23:40:27
Have you had enough?

[GM] 23:40:31
Dex? Uh… yes.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:33
Is there any chest left now?

[GM] 23:40:38
Yes, there are gaping wounds, and there's blood profusely pouring out of them.

[GM] 23:40:42
It's… it's spraying everywhere. It's, like, all over. Uh, all over, uh, ink.

[Ink] 23:40:47
I'm dancing.

[GM] 23:40:49
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:40:51
Um, what would happen if I just, like, go at it with the spanner?

[GM] 23:40:56
Yeah, it might kill it, who knows?

[Dex Miro] 23:40:59
I don't know if that's an effective weapon, but…

[GM] 23:41:02
Um, you wanna, like, try and crush its skull in? Uh, it's probably more like a strength?

[Dex Miro] 23:41:05
Yeah. Yeah.

[GM] 23:41:08
Or, uh, yeah, strength than a… than a combat.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:11
Yeah. Okay, strength's not worth step, but let's do it.

[GM] 23:41:19
Oh, I…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:41:20
Wow.

[Ink] 23:41:22
Yes!

[Murderbot V2] 23:41:23
Wow!

[GM] 23:41:23
All right, uh, that spanner is heavy. Uh… Cracking on the skull, because that's what we said, let's do 4010 on that.

[GM] 23:41:39
There's a sickening crunch as the spanner, like, lodges its side of the creature's head.

[GM] 23:41:47
It shakes for just a second and falls to the ground.

[Dex Miro] 23:41:51
Now I have to, like, put my boot on its head and pull the spanner out.

[GM] 23:41:54
Yeah, it's gonna… yeah, you know, there's, like, a bit of crunch when you… when you pull out.

[GM] 23:42:00
Spanner's got those, like, ridges, like, those teeth, uh, that kind of help.

[GM] 23:42:06
Lock it into place and stuff, and there's, like, brain goo in between all the teeth, you'll have to clean that out later.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:12
Great.

[GM] 23:42:15
What's the… Craziest set of rules.

[GM] 23:42:19
It's just… crit… crit. Success, success. Um.

[GM] 23:42:26
Yeah. You guys did it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:29
Good job, all!

[Ink] 23:42:30
That was amazing. I think we should go to bed now.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:42:36
The rolls. The roles can't get any better, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:36
Before we fail again, is what you're saying? Yeah.

[Ink] 23:42:37
It can't get any better than that.

[Murderbot V2] 23:42:39
Yeah, we don't need to… we don't need to roll anymore.

[Dex Miro] 23:42:43
Wait, do we hear more of? Just… wait, what is this thing? Can we take a closer look at it?

[GM] 23:42:50
Uh… yeah, you flip it over. Um… Yeah. You use xenobiology. You look at it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:42:52
I give them xenobiology, I'll look at it.

[GM] 23:43:00
Uh, it was human once upon a time. Um, and you look at the extra arms, and they're…

[GM] 23:43:08
Um. Not only is it's, uh, like, basically arm's been dislodged.

[GM] 23:43:15
To accommodate the extra arms. So. It's topmost, you know, like, the closest to its head are actually set higher.

[GM] 23:43:24
The normal arms are, and then, like, below that, and sort of, like, the rib area.

[GM] 23:43:28
You see the… the extra arms are sort of attached with the… Um, a combination of flesh and metal.

[GM] 23:43:37
There's, like, essentially, like. Both, uh, wires and tendons that have grown into the arms, um, and then there's another set of arms that are, like, closer to the hips.

[GM] 23:43:47
Um. The creatures… eyes, um…

[GM] 23:43:53
Don't have pupils, they're all black. Um, so they don't resemble human eyes at all, and its jaw is, like, disjointed in a way that's much larger. Like, it accommodates more space than a normal human jaw.

[GM] 23:44:07
It has these sort of four… long, protruding fangs.

[GM] 23:44:13
Um… But yeah, it probably was humid at one point.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:44:20
Doctor, I can give you Gil's been experimenting. Or, um…

[Dex Miro] 23:44:23
So a lot of this is, like, mods, then?

[GM] 23:44:27
Uh, it's more than mods. Um, you know, like, most mods, like, it's like, you know…

[GM] 23:44:35
Your arm turns into a cannon or something, like, that's all mechanical. It doesn't typically have this sort of integration with, like.

[GM] 23:44:43
Um, with flesh, in a way.

[Dex Miro] 23:44:45
I have a med scanner, too. Can we learn anything extra from that?

[GM] 23:44:50
Um… Yeah, uh, you can… you scan the body.

[GM] 23:44:57
Um… it does, like, most of its DNA is human.

[Ink] 23:44:59
Future update.

[GM] 23:45:01
Um, there seems to be some sort of… Uh, cancer… that's, um…

[GM] 23:45:09
Is both malignant and benign? Like, the machine kind of, like.

[GM] 23:45:12
Is… giving weird readings on that. Um… And, um…

[GM] 23:45:22
What else? Uh, there's… there's actually. What's that?

[Dex Miro] 23:45:24
Like, dark cancer or unrelated cancer. Like CAR cancer or unrelated cancer.

[GM] 23:45:30
Unrelated to car cancer, um…

[Dex Miro] 23:45:31
Okay.

[GM] 23:45:36
Um… Let me see… might be, like, one more piece of information.

[GM] 23:46:05
Um…

[GM] 23:46:18
Yeah, okay.

[GM] 23:46:26
They're… sort of redundant organs as well.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:33
Okay.

[GM] 23:46:36
But it's… it's well and dead. It, like… Scanner's like, there's no… no active vitals.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:45
Oh, it's got, like, extra lungs, heart, and all that.

[GM] 23:46:49
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:46:58
Maybe some of that would help you survive a little extra environment, so that kind of makes sense.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:02
But it's still really weird.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:10
So does it look like it's… So it's not like surgical, it just looks like something… like the cancer altered its DNA, and then it just grew the extra organs.

[GM] 23:47:21
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:47:31
Alright. It's… I don't like it here.

[Ink] 23:47:37
This is awesome, this is why I joined the company. Man, that is good.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:47
Yeah, let's get… let's get out of here.

[Ink] 23:47:47
Great, guys.

[GM] 23:47:48
Um… the…

[GM] 23:47:53
You still haven't found the equipment for fixing this thing.

[Ink] 23:47:57
We looked in the other room.

[Murderbot V2] 23:47:57
Oh, I dare it.

[GM] 23:48:00
Uh, you go up to the next… area, there's the filter.

[GM] 23:48:05
Um, you see the… Equipment staying there, that it's… it's sort of…

[GM] 23:48:10
Scattered about, but it's like… up here. And so… Um, some… some scientists might be able to fix this thing.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:19
Oh, do we have one of those?

[Dex Miro] 23:48:24
Allegedly.

[GM] 23:48:25
You can roll intelligence with any kind of additional bonus from a relevant skill, Zeke.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:26
At lunch.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:48:27
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:48:32
God, I don't have very many relevant skills in mechanics, um… Sadly. Um, math…

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:48:37
You don't have, like, engineering or something?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:48:41
I don't have engineering, I'm, like, a biologist.

[Ink] 23:48:46
Have heavy machinery.

[GM] 23:48:49
I don't actually know all the skills.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:48:50
I'm gonna… I'm gonna count biology, because… account biology, like, that's… that's a life support system.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:51
I have mechanical repair. I got a cow car repair.

[Murderbot V2] 23:48:56
I'll do it. Oh, wait, is it, uh, let's see here…

[GM] 23:48:59
Um…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:49:04
I'm giving myself… Is it modifier?

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:04
Would it be… Intellect?

[GM] 23:49:11
Alright, uh, Murderbot helps, he assists you. You can make your check with Advantage, but uh… You won't get… not… you don't add biology to it.

[GM] 23:49:24
Okay. You… that's a critical success.

[GM] 23:49:29
You fixed the hell out of this thing. Uh, it gets up and running, the lights come back on.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:32
Sweet.

[GM] 23:49:38
Um… it's like… you feel like there's, like, a blast of air that kind of comes out of it, um…

[GM] 23:49:44
That's how well you fix it. And, like… Um.

[Ink] 23:49:48
You're gonna be a hero.

[GM] 23:49:50
He might become a hero!

[Murderbot V2] 23:49:52
Hold on, I fucking did it.

[Dex Miro] 23:49:54
You did?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:49:56
Just… you don't even breathe air.

[GM] 23:49:58
You, you assisted him.

[Murderbot V2] 23:50:01
The fuck?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:50:03
Thank you, Assistant. I appreciate you holding up.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:50:09
The panel, so I could… Get in there, and…

[GM] 23:50:10
The lights.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:13
We'll make sure to put you in a footnote in the academic paper.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:50:16
Mm-hmm.

[GM] 23:50:19
Yeah, it's… it's up and running. You. This thing probably doesn't, you know, so long as someone doesn't sabotage us or anything, like, this.

[GM] 23:50:27
This'll run for a good long time. I don't know. It was… maybe somebody might sabotage it.

[Dex Miro] 23:50:28
Why would you say that, GM?

[GM] 23:50:35
Yeah. Um… Yeah. You guys… I don't… um…

[GM] 23:50:43
Yeah, you head back to… head back to DOPTown. Uh, one of you… you know, probably Zeke.

[GM] 23:50:49
Feels so confident in his work, he pulls off his, uh… This hazmat thing is just like…

[GM] 23:50:55
It just, you know, the errors is… Fresh. Um… Insofar as that you can easily breathe.

[GM] 23:51:02
But there's a lot of smells of dead things now, suddenly.

[Dex Miro] 23:51:07
Alright, now we've got all that decomposing going.

[GM] 23:51:12
Um, when you exit the building, um, it's still dark. In the surroundings, but this building, uh, sort of stands out as a…

[GM] 23:51:21
A beacon of light, uh, in the midst of the darkness.

[GM] 23:51:25
Um… the… it's not immediate that the error, uh, like, it doesn't, like, instantly rush back in and everything's sort of fixed, but, like.

[GM] 23:51:36
It's noticeable. Um… once you get a bit far away from the thing, you put your hazmat suit back on, as far as, like, the oxygen part.

[GM] 23:51:46
Um. And, uh, yeah.

[GM] 23:51:51
Uh, when you reach the edge of the slums, uh, those.

[GM] 23:51:54
Same 5 armored, uh… Uh… insurgents approach you and say.

[GM] 23:52:03
Um, did you fix it? These are the cards, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:52:05
This is the spirit guys, or the guards? Okay.

[Ink] 23:52:09
They can't tell we fixed it yet, because they're not smelling the oxygen yet.

[GM] 23:52:12
Well, I mean. Yeah, there hasn't, you know, been a noticeable change just yet. Oh, maybe it's noticeable to some, but…

[GM] 23:52:21
Um. They might have kills.

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:22
They're gil people.

[Ink] 23:52:25
Probably needs to be guarded, though.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:52:33
It's fixed, just you wait.

[Murderbot V2] 23:52:35
Just you wait!

[GM] 23:52:35
Alright, we'll wait. Um.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:52:41
Yeah.

[GM] 23:52:42
That sounds good. Um… We'll take you to a safe house, and Imogene will join you once we've got.

[GM] 23:52:48
Good sense that it is fixed. Um, so it'll take you to a residence, you sit there for…

[GM] 23:52:57
Um, a couple of hours… Uh, and uh…

[GM] 23:53:03
Imogene shows up shortly thereafter, and she says, god damn it, you did it.

[GM] 23:53:07
Already, I could just see the children. They can breathe again.

[GM] 23:53:15
Was there a monster?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:53:17
Yes.

[Ink] 23:53:20
Can we have, like, brought back his head? Yeah, we like… here's the monster. Do you recognize him?

[GM] 23:53:22
Sure, yeah, you could pro-. Holy shit, what the fuck is that?

[Murderbot V2] 23:53:28
We don't know. We thought you might know.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 23:53:31
We're new here.

[GM] 23:53:36
Um… yeah, I don't know what the hell that thing is. Uh, I've never seen anything like that.

[GM] 23:53:42
That… that's what destroyed the… the… the air filters?

[GM] 23:53:49
The Life Support Tower?

[Ink] 23:53:50
Not sure about that, but I might have kept it from getting fixed. We're, uh… We're worried there's more foul play going on here, and we… we think you should protect it.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:53:50
And being.

[GM] 23:53:59
I'll send my best to go and protect it, I mean… Hell. You fixed it so good that… maybe we won't even need to…

[GM] 23:54:07
Try and, uh, run this insurgency anymore.

[Ink] 23:54:11
Well, about that… about that insurgency, what do you know about the people running this… this base?

[GM] 23:54:17
Oh, uh, the Bratva? They're… they're not terrible.

[GM] 23:54:23
Insofar as that they're just mostly greedy. Um, you know, the… people sent down here into Dop Town.

[GM] 23:54:32
It's really just a matter of money. Um, it's not malicious.

[GM] 23:54:37
Uh, there are a few in Tempest Company that take joy in harming people, and um… seeing our suffering, but for the most part, it's just a matter of.

[GM] 23:54:47
Financial, uh… Wall Street distribution. You know, they want to be rich.

[GM] 23:54:53
We can't pay, they put us down here. If we've got O2 for free.

[GM] 23:54:59
Um… I mean… They don't have anything on us anymore.

[Ink] 23:55:06
But it doesn't…

[GM] 23:55:06
Not that we… they weren't getting anything more out of us anyways. I mean, we're down here because we have nothing.

[Ink] 23:55:12
So hopefully this is not a threat, because they weren't getting more money out of you anyway. You might be more productive, might help them.

[Ink] 23:55:18
So they don't have an incentive to keep you guys. Deoxygenated.

[GM] 23:55:22
No. No.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:55:23
No, but the people upstairs that we're paying don't have to pay anymore.

[GM] 23:55:28
Um, I don't know if our oxygen's connected to theirs. As much as I've tried to figure out a way to… to connect these two things, I haven't been able to figure it out.

[GM] 23:55:39
Uh… my plan, I'll just tell you, because I don't think I have to carry it out anymore, is that.

[GM] 23:55:43
I was gonna ask you guys to break us into the, uh… The icebox? You know where they got all the… all those sleeves?

[GM] 23:55:51
I was gonna download everyone in here. Into those sleeves.

[Dex Miro] 23:55:56
So what's this sleeve? Is that…?

[GM] 23:56:00
It's a body. You know.

[GM] 23:56:05
Just, you know, transfer some consciousnesses.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:05
Clearly, you haven't played Cyberpunk 2077.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:06
So you're, like, transferring yourself into somebody else's body?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:56:10
As, like, a cyborg, or is it a…

[GM] 23:56:11
No, it's just a… it's just a VAT-grown human. With no consciousness in it.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:14
It's a… it's a fully cloned body, just without the consciousness.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:18
Um, wild.

[GM] 23:56:19
Yeah. I'm pretty sure they got enough sleeves up there for almost all the people down here.

[GM] 23:56:29
So, getting a sleeve is so expensive that… We're gonna have to just… fighter way to… to them.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:29
Wait…

[Dex Miro] 23:56:37
So, if you get a sleeve, what happens to the actual you?

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:43
Your conscience leaves your… current body, and is then downloaded into the new sleeve.

[GM] 23:56:49
It could use it as a backup, I think.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:51
So you just, like, keep them in the closet, and then you're like, I feel like wearing this one today.

[Dex Miro] 23:56:55
And you just… Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 23:56:55
Well, there would be just industrial-sized storage machines.

[GM] 23:56:56
Sure.

[GM] 23:57:07
But health, uh… Yeah, I don't need to do that anymore.

[GM] 23:57:13
You've basically freed us.

[GM] 23:57:18
How can I repay you? I don't have a lot of money or anything. Um, we've got some weapons that we don't need anymore.

[GM] 23:57:26
Nothing… she looks at… she motions to your pulse rifles, like, nothing more powerful than that, really, but… You know…

[Ink] 23:57:32
I'm guessing. Can I, uh, can I take an aside with my guys here to talk about something real quick?

[Murderbot V2] 23:57:42
What do you want?

[Ink] 23:57:43
Um, I'm wondering if we should let her in on kind of why we're here, or if we can get her to, uh.

[Ink] 23:57:49
Assist us in getting rid of the drugs and taking out the leader.

[Dex Miro] 23:57:56
Put that directly, let's start with just by… Why don't we just ask her what she knows about Sycorax first?

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:03
Yeah, I wouldn't volunteer that we're working for the company, because.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:07
You know, rebellious types don't often like, you know, big greedy companies.

[Ink] 23:58:11
That's true. I like that sound. Yeah, because it almost seems like we wanted to instigate her carrying that out, but uh…

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:58:13
I think they'll go over well.

[Ink] 23:58:19
I don't know if she'd be willing to do that anymore, sacrifice her people.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:23
So, um, should we… Maybe not leave that tracker around here.

[Ink] 23:58:30
Yeah, we may not… because I'm worried if we go back for the 10K, why would this guy be interested? Why would they be interested in her, I guess, is the real question.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:30
Murderbot.

[Dex Miro] 23:58:36
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:58:37
1,000 credit.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:37
We could ask him, or ask her why he would be, no?

[Ink] 23:58:42
That reveals us, right? A little bit, our… our intentions, potentially, so that…

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:45
No, we could be like, hey, this guy was asking around about you up there.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:50
What's… what's the history, or something like that, no?

[Ink] 23:58:53
I guess the worry was that they were going to do an insurrection, right? That was the rumors, and they wanted to cut it off.

[Murderbot V2] 23:58:58
Oh, so we already know? I don't know if he told us that. I mean, this was like a hackathon! It was like a contest or something, right?

[Ink] 23:59:00
That's what… that's what… that's what I would assume. We kind of knew… We've got a new company.

[Zeke Sinclair] 23:59:03
Probably right.

[Ink] 23:59:08
We kind of knew going in that they were going to do a rebellion, that she was the leader of an potential insurrection.

[Ink] 23:59:14
Somehow, right?

[Murderbot V2] 23:59:14
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:17
Right, so why don't we just say, like, the… I forget what the Hacker Club was, has a bounty on it… out on you, do you know what that's all about?

[Ink] 23:59:26
Yeah, canyon.market. Right?

[GM] 23:59:30
Yeah.

[Ink] 23:59:33
Okay. Well, if there was rumors that she was going to insurrect, right, then that's why she… now we need to dispel those rumors up there, because she shouldn't hope.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:33
Like, it seems like you're just trying to survive down here. I don't know why they'd be coming after you.

[Dex Miro] 23:59:44
Right, I get that. That's what I'm saying to her. Yeah.

[Ink] 23:59:48
Oh, gotcha. Basic.

[GM] 23:59:49
He's in character. Um, she says.

[GM] 23:59:54
Uh, I mean, there's more than that. We already carried out a couple of attacks to… try and figure out, you know, penetrate some defenses and such.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:00
Okay.

[GM] 00:00:02
I'm not… I wouldn't be surprised at all if Bratva had… had a bounty on my head.

[Ink] 00:00:17
Um, do you know anything about the drug trade that's going on?

[GM] 00:00:21
Oh, do I. I know more than most. Yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:22
No. Do tell.

[Ink] 00:00:25
Oh, detailed. Mm.

[GM] 00:00:29
Is it more fun to just stop on that cliffhanger, or…?

[Murderbot V2] 00:00:30
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:00:32
I think that's probably a good idea.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:00:35
It is exactly midnight.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:00:36
So I'll just forget what she said in the next week.

[GM] 00:00:37
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:00:40
None of the stations on fire are burning down, man, like…

[Ink] 00:00:48
We only killed a few children.

[Dex Miro] 00:00:53
Was that, uh, honey. Yeah, that was…

[GM] 00:00:54
Disfigured children at that. Horribly disfigured children.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:00
Probably much more horrifying than the actual alien thing.

[Ink] 00:01:05
Well, yeah, you weren't grabbed by him and being carried up a wall.

[Dex Miro] 00:01:09
Alright, that is a matter of perspective, but…

[Ink] 00:01:16
I finally got him covered in ketchup. There we go. It would not make an impact.

[GM] 00:01:21
Go from ketchup.

[Ink] 00:01:22
Yeah, Gemini was too smart. It's like, nah, that's not ketchup. And ChatGPT is like, yeah, we'll cover them in ketchup.

[GM] 00:01:31
We'll layer that ketchup on there. Yeah, that's… Yeah, that's pretty good.

[Ink] 00:01:33
Yeah. Too late cover to catch up. With a spanner in his head.

[GM] 00:01:38
He did end up with a tail, which… that's fine. Um…

[Dex Miro] 00:01:42
I love how the hardest part about AI generating images is just to convince it that it's okay to generate them.

[GM] 00:01:51
I like the picture of you getting abducted, like, you're, like, look like you're having a good time. You're like… Ink's like, yeah, this is great!

[Dex Miro] 00:01:56
Yeah. The very first time I looked at that, like, I didn't click on it, so I just saw the thumbnail, and I thought it was, like, after he survived, and then I clicked on it, and, like, there's the horrifying thing over his shoulder grabbing it.

[Murderbot V2] 00:02:12
He's like.

[Ink] 00:02:17
Oh, oh, GM, GM, I have zero G. Does that mean I'm really good in the cowboy place?

[GM] 00:02:17
Bruh.

[GM] 00:02:23
Yeah, yeah, you're very impressive, moving from terminal to terminal. Everyone's very impressed.

[GM] 00:02:32
Wow, a lot of criticals. That's crazy, you guys were doing shit, and then all of a sudden, just crit, crit, crit.

[Dex Miro] 00:02:38
I feel like you expected the alien to murder us.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:02:42
Seems like you're

[GM] 00:02:42
Um, I probably… I could have probably played it just a little bit smarter?

[GM] 00:02:47
And that… so, I'll just reveal that. The, uh, the bruising, the 1 inch diameter length thing.

[Dex Miro] 00:02:54
Yeah.

[GM] 00:02:54
Uh, its tongue? Can extend and, like, acts as a whip, in a way.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:00
Oh… Oh!

[GM] 00:03:01
And when you're hit by it, you get paralyzed. Uh, and then it just, you know, sucks the blood out of you once you're paralyzed.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:04
Okay. Right.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:09
If there's just one of you, that's extremely affected, yeah.

[GM] 00:03:09
But I kind of thought, well… Right. And I was like, well, if I carry Ink away and then paralyze him, then I can just kill him.

[GM] 00:03:18
Um, so that was the plan. Uh, but then he got stopped.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:23
Yeah, from dual 11s.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:24
Uh, I'd like to say that MVP of this session was fucking Murderbot.

[Ink] 00:03:30
I think so. Good.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:31
Because he stopped the… he stopped the creature, and then, also, he fixed the fucking thing himself. That's… No, that wasn't an assist. Literally, it's called Mechanical Repair.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:03:32
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:39
Just held the panel open.

[GM] 00:03:39
He assists… he assisted.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:40
All by himself.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:46
And all Zeke did was just like, oh yeah, I think that goes in there.

[GM] 00:03:46
Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:03:49
I did the science thing. It was…

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:51
Get the fuck outta here.

[Dex Miro] 00:03:56
Seems like there's always a lot of debate over who's in charge and who's the assistant.

[Murderbot V2] 00:03:59
Yeah, Murderbot gets the extra XP this session.

[GM] 00:04:02
I mean, the thing is that… For all the failures that you guys had going into this, like…

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:09
Yeah, it all… all came… karma came back.

[GM] 00:04:10
Um… the, like, fixing the, um, critically fixing the, um, life support is, like, way…

[GM] 00:04:20
Way more. It's, like, way better than, like, you know, wasting your ammo on, like.

[GM] 00:04:25
A child or whatever, right? Like, it's like… um, you know, having… having the…

[GM] 00:04:31
Even though the outcomes potentially are, like, death for your characters, like.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:31
On a child.

[GM] 00:04:35
You really want to succeed at, like, something like that, where it's like… you're essentially… you went from, like, oh, that's cool, you fixed it, great job, to you're a fucking hero.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:38
Yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:04:47
Right.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:04:52
Oh, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 00:04:54
Oh, yeah…

[Dex Miro] 00:04:55
So, I'm a little lost on… Which picture is which person?

[Ink] 00:05:03
Does it not come with titles for them?

[Dex Miro] 00:05:06
No, I always just get the UUIDs.

[Ink] 00:05:08
Oh, gotcha, okay. So, um, if you look at the… Oh, you don't have those either, okay. You know, because, oh, he's got… he's got it missing now. Um, alright, starting from the…

[Ink] 00:05:18
The lady opening her suit.

[Ink] 00:05:24
You see her? If there's pink around her and stuff.

[Carnoc Ashbrow] 00:05:38
That's way back. It's like… 10 pictures back or something.

[Ink] 00:05:39
Yeah. Right after the… after the… That's supposed to be Imogene.

[GM] 00:05:42
Is that… is that supposed to be Imogene? Well, yeah, I tried giving her an anarchist symbol.

[Ink] 00:05:48
Yeah, I did. I didn't quite do the… That's just from our… the script. I just… I fed it the, uh, the transcript in there and told me to give me a prompt.

[Ink] 00:05:57
So that's the image. You see, Dex, what I'm talking about.

[Dex Miro] 00:06:02
The one with them. The one with the long tongue is not Imogene.

[GM] 00:06:06
No, it's like 3 pictures down from that one. That's Indayl.

[Ink] 00:06:06
No, the… Yeah, sorry, the one with the long tongue is the lady that runs…

[Dex Miro] 00:06:08
Yeah.

[GM] 00:06:13
Yeah. They… they run.

[Ink] 00:06:14
She… she runs the… she runs Heaven… Oh, they. Sorry.

[Ink] 00:06:20
They run Heaven, or do they run the lower downstairs place? They run the downstairs place, right?

[GM] 00:06:24
They run, uh, Ecstasy.

[Ink] 00:06:26
Ecstasy. Okay, so they run ecstasy. There's two pictures of they, them, them.

[GM] 00:06:32
Actually, that, uh, getting off the… TurboLift is actually a really good, like, representation of what's going on.

[Ink] 00:06:33
Um, so pick whichever one you like there. And then… then the next image is… is of us getting off of the turbo lift.

[Ink] 00:06:40
Into DOPTown. And then the other one is actually back to the zero-G.

[Ink] 00:06:47
Canyon Heavy.Market.

[GM] 00:06:57
That's, like, really good.

[Ink] 00:06:59
I'll tell ChatGPT a good job. It only took me about 3 times to get that one just right.

[Ink] 00:07:08
Um, in other words, imaging, and…

[GM] 00:07:10
Mark. It's good.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:12
So Imogene's the one in the suit with, like, her hands like this.

[GM] 00:07:14
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:07:16
She's, yeah, she's going like that. That's Imogene. And then, um, Ingus is the runner of Canyon Market, right?

[Dex Miro] 00:07:18
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:07:24
Yeah, so he's the next image, looking to the side with all kinds of cybernetic stuff on him.

[Dex Miro] 00:07:29
Yeah, that one makes sense. So that I didn't know who the next one was.

[Ink] 00:07:33
And then the next one…

[GM] 00:07:34
As Brunhilda.

[Ink] 00:07:41
Yeah, that's Brunhilda, she runs the place. She's the judge, right?

[GM] 00:07:45
She's a judge.

[Ink] 00:07:48
And then the other one's Akko Akka, which is, like, the… guy that runs the sun place?

[GM] 00:07:55
Yeah, Solarian Church.

[Ink] 00:07:57
And those are the only ones there. GM gave images for. We haven't met any of those, I guess, other than, uh… Um, we met Ingus.

[GM] 00:08:04
Yeah. Well, kind of. I mean, you saw them from a distance. He wasn't the one that gave you the direct, um… Yeah, it was just, like, you… you walked in there, they're like.

[Ink] 00:08:05
There, I think it's… Oh, he didn't even get… okay, gotcha.

[GM] 00:08:13
You know, they told you, essentially, this mission came from Ingus, but… Yeah, it wasn't him that delivered it.

[Ink] 00:08:19
GM gave us images of those people, so I tried to… actually, like.

[Ink] 00:08:22
You have the images up still, GM, I'm assuming, because it looks… pretty much exists.

[GM] 00:08:26
They did… it was pretty good. Don't go… don't go post in your chat GPT, otherwise we'll get in trouble for, uh, probably, like, copyright infringement or something.

[Ink] 00:08:33
Yeah, those are actually from… so there's a new image generator from Google called Nano Banana.

[Ink] 00:08:38
And it just… it crushes it. It is very, very… it's stricter than ChatGPT on censorship, so, like, when I try to put ketchup on people, it's like, no.

[Dex Miro] 00:08:40
Banana.

[GM] 00:08:47
I know what you're doing, but buddy.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:08:47
Oh, wow.

[Ink] 00:08:49
Yeah, so that's why you'll see the style change when I go back to ChatGPT, which is slightly loose, or at least I figured out how to get rid of some of the prompts, but… Um, yeah.

[Ink] 00:08:58
And then… the doorway there's supposed to be, which I don't think turned out quite as well as I'd like with the doorway we couldn't go into.

[GM] 00:09:08
Oh, the one with the wires and stuff, yeah. That's not too bad.

[Ink] 00:09:09
Yeah. Now, I was trying to make the crack… the crack in the wall is probably a little bit too large, but I generate, like, 5 of those, and I was like, screw it, so…

[Dex Miro] 00:09:11
Yeah, that's pretty good.

[Dex Miro] 00:09:18
I mean, the only weird thing is it just doesn't… Either the door is way too big or the building's too small.

[GM] 00:09:18
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:09:24
Oh, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:09:24
Is the only weird thing about that image. Because it's got, like, stars around it that looks like it's outside, but it's not, right?

[Dex Miro] 00:09:32
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:09:34
And then I think the rest of them are pretty self-explanatory. Yeah, the first thing it made Murderbot Inc. With no hazard suits on, I wanted to put hazard suits on, so…

[Dex Miro] 00:09:51
And the one with… Just the arms around Murderbot, it's just weird.

[Ink] 00:09:57
I only tried that one once, and… Because they're supposed to be choking him, but it was never going to do that.

[GM] 00:10:05
I mean, that's kind of how… as effective as it was. Like, he was like, why is this kid on me? Why is it…

[Dex Miro] 00:10:09
Yeah.

[Ink] 00:10:13
Now he just wears those arms as, like, his necklace, yeah.

[Murderbot V2] 00:10:23
Uh, what are we playing next?

[Dex Miro] 00:10:24
Well, the Icebox one is pretty cool, too. From earlier in the…

[Dex Miro] 00:10:30
Yeah. With, like, all the cylinders with the… sleeves in them, I guess. That's a good picture.

[Ink] 00:10:37
Oh, yeah, GM, with the sleeves. So when you upload yourself into a sleeve, are you still in your regular body?

[GM] 00:10:44
Um, I think they're… Well, let me look to see what happens.

[Ink] 00:10:52
Because Zeke wants to, like, upload himself to all the sleeves, and he's like an army of Zeke's to take over the station, is what I had in mind.

[GM] 00:10:58
Okay. Where's the icebox?

[GM] 00:11:05
Icebox. Alright.

[Ink] 00:11:08
Because she was gonna upload them into the sleeves to take over.

[GM] 00:11:12
Yeah. Alright.

[GM] 00:11:41
Memories for future upload into a sleeve. I would presume that you could have…

[GM] 00:11:48
Multiple consciousnesses, then.

[Ink] 00:11:49
All right, that's… okay, we're gonna have fun then. Um, so it's like, uh, did you ever see… Oh, shoot, what's the name of that TV show where they… they wake up on the spaceship and they've forgotten their memories?

[Ink] 00:12:02
Dark… is dark matter? Nobody else wanted to talk about?

[GM] 00:12:05
I don't know. But there was another… there was another show that was, like, uh, was it Netflix?

[GM] 00:12:13
Had a… It was all about, like…

[GM] 00:12:19
Basically downloading yourself into new bodies.

[Ink] 00:12:22
Oh, um, Aeon… what is it, uh… shoot, it starts with A, something, right?

[Ink] 00:12:27
You got, like, a memory core that you keep transferring around, right?

[GM] 00:12:32
Yeah. Yeah. So long as that thing doesn't get broken, then you're, like, it's not murder.

[GM] 00:12:38
Right? Like, you can stab and kill somebody, but then just, like, oh, just put your new body.

[GM] 00:12:43
Um… I think it had the guy from…

[GM] 00:12:55
What was the movie that Peacemaker showed up in?

[Murderbot V2] 00:13:01
Superman?

[GM] 00:13:02
No. That's the most recent one. What's the… It's not dispendable… expendable, that's the fucking Arnold Schwartz Suicide Squad.

[Murderbot V2] 00:13:09
True Sight Squad?

[GM] 00:13:11
That's it, because I think… the guy who played…

[GM] 00:13:17
Um…

[GM] 00:13:21
Rick Flagg. I think he's in that show with the sleeves.

[Ink] 00:13:29
What's the name of that show? There we go. Hey.

[GM] 00:13:31
Altered carbon. That's it.

[Dex Miro] 00:13:35
Yeah, I didn't watch that, but I… To remember people mentioning it.

[Murderbot V2] 00:13:37
Well, I watched that. It was… interesting, yeah.

[Dex Miro] 00:13:38
It's good.

[GM] 00:13:39
It's okay.

[Ink] 00:13:42
So in dark matter, they don't have transporters, but they have this technology where you upload yourself into a copy of yourself somewhere way far away.

[Ink] 00:13:49
And as long as that U makes it back, you get your memories uploaded back to you of their experience.

[Ink] 00:13:55
But if you get killed, you don't get your memories back.

[Ink] 00:13:59
Like, for what… whatever happened on that… that side of… the Galaxy.

[GM] 00:14:03
Mm-hmm.

[Ink] 00:14:08
There's the… there's a video of, uh… Zeke sitting in his… his living room, too.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:14:15
There you go. Let's see this video.

[GM] 00:14:21
Downloaded… Seeing Zeke's sitting in his living room.

[Dex Miro] 00:14:33
What? No.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:14:37
I look a little more creepy than the girl.

[GM] 00:14:40
I know.

[Dex Miro] 00:14:46
Yeah, the expression on your face is weird. Yeah.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:14:49
It, like, warps from the bottom of my face, it's weird.

[GM] 00:14:53
Your jaw got wider.

[Ink] 00:15:02
It took me two tries to get that right, but it worked pretty well the second time.

[Zeke Sinclair] 00:15:04
That's, yeah, it's pretty good.

[Ink] 00:15:08
It's totally what it looked like was gonna happen as you were sitting there.

[Dex Miro] 00:15:10
But he doesn't look, like, frightened that somebody's suddenly breathing on the back of his neck.

[Murderbot V2] 00:15:14
That is creepy AF.

[GM] 00:15:20
That's because he wouldn't be frightened unless they were pickled.
